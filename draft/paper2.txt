    %\footnote{There are different observational definitions of ``environment''. 
    %In this paper, we use the term ``environment'' and halo mass interchangeably}.
    
    %Previous work has shown that the half-light radii of massive ETGs is tightly 
    %correlated with \mstar{} (e.g. \citealt{Shen2003, Guo2009}). 
    %Models based on the ``two-phase'' formation scenario naturally predict that this

    Massive central galaxies in this work show an intriguing diversity on the plane 
    defined by these two metrics.  
    We preview this using Fig~\ref{fig:m100_m10_color}, which shows a subsample of 
    massive galaxies at $z{\sim} 0.4$ that share very similar value of \minn{}, but 
    exhibit a large diversity in their outer profiles. 
    Assuming that galaxies at fixed \minn{} share a similar in-situ formation history, 
    it is of great interest to investigate the relation between their present day halo 
    mass and the extend of their outer envelopes. 
    We note that although a circular aperture is shown on Fig~\ref{fig:m100_m10_color}, 
    for our mass measurements, we always use elliptical apertures that follow the 
    average isophotal shape. Finally, given our narrow mass and redshift range, we 
    can safely ignore significant mass growth and structural evolution in this work
    (no star formation, lower merger rate \etal~e.g.\ \citealt{Bellstedt2016},
    \citealt{Inagaki2015}; but also see \citealt{Bai2014}). 

Completeness that depends on halo mass:

    The \rbcg{} sample is less affected by completeness because we can utilize 
    photo-$z$s from \redm{}. 
    However, the completeness of the \nbcg{} sample is still limited by the 
    availability of spec-$z$s from BOSS.

    When comparing \nbcg{} and \rbcg{} we will also always make sure that the two 
    samples are well matched both in terms of \mstar{} as well as in terms of redshift. 
    Please see the next section and Appendix~\ref{app:match} for more details.

\subsubsection{Environmental Dependence of the Profiles of Massive Galaxies}
    \label{sssec:sbp_mtot} 
       
    We now ask whether or not galaxies from our sample have \mden{} profiles that 
    depend on \mhalo{} (at fixed \mstar{}). 
    For this, we will build matched samples drawing from \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} that are 
    carefully matched in \mstar{} and redshift using a KDTree algorithm 
    (see Appendix~\ref{app:match} and Fig~\ref{fig:match} for details). 
    By matching the redshift distributions within $0.3 < z < 0.5$, we ensure that the 
    \mden{} profiles from both samples are impacted by seeing and background subtraction 
    at similar levels. 
    To match the two samples by stellar mass, we will use two different methods:
      
    \begin{itemize}
    
        \item We match the two samples according to \mtot{}. 
            We select galaxies from \rbcg{} with $11.6 < $\logmtot{} $<11.9$ 
            (median \logmtot{} ${\sim} 11.74$). 
            There are 45 \rbcg{} galaxies in this range. 
            We then match this distribution by drawing galaxies from \nbcg{}. 
            There are 229 unique \nbcg{} galaxies in the matched sample. 
            In this \mtot{} range, 100 kpc corresponds to 5-8 times the effective radius 
            and \mtot{} is a good proxy of total stellar mass.     
        
       \item We match the two samples according to \minn{}. 
           We select galaxies from \rbcg{} with $11.2 < $\logminn{}$ < 11.6$ 
            (median \logminn{}${\sim} 11.36$).
            For the 56 galaxies from the \rbcg{} sample, we achieve excellent matches
            in \minn{} and redshift using 375 \nbcg{} galaxies.
            Motivated by recent observations and simulations, we use \minn{} as the 
            proxy of the \mstar{} of the ``in-situ'' component.
            We will discuss more about this assumption in 
            Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.   
                 
    \end{itemize}

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%     
    Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1} compares the profiles of galaxies at fixed \mtot{} and at fixed 
    \minn{} for our two matched samples, and shows the main results of this paper which 
    is that we find a clear halo mass dependence in the \mden{} profiles of massive 
    galaxies. 
    The bottom panel of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1} shows the difference between the two 
    profiles, $\Delta = \log(\mu_{\star, \mathrm{cenHighMh}}) - 
    \log(\mu_{\star, \mathrm{cenLowMh}})$, 
    with errors computed via bootstrap resampling. 
    In Appendix~\ref{app:robust}, we present a variety of tests that verify the 
    robustness of these results against different uncertainties.
   
    There are several important points to be noticed in Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}. 
    First, when galaxies are matched by \mtot{}, although we detect a robust 
    environmental dependence, it mainly only becomes prominent in the outskirts 
    at $R>50$ kpc. 
    This partially explains the difficulties for previous works to detect this effect
    on shallower images. 
    Second, we find that central galaxies in more massive dark mater halos display 
    more flattened inner profile and more significant outer stellar envelope than 
    the ones living in less massive halos. 
    Third, the median \mden{} profiles of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} cross each other 
    at ${\sim} 15$-20 kpc, the expected $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ for ETGs at this \mtot{}. 
    Finally, such systematic difference in structure may become more significant 
    at very high-mass end. 
    We see evidence of this effect when we compare the $Delta$ profiles in two \mtot{} 
    bins (see Fig~\ref{fig:prof_2} and discussion in 
    Appendix~\ref{app:robust})\footnote{Though the lower \mtot{} bin becomes somewhat
    incomplete} and when we discuss the relation between \mtot{} and \minn{} for 
    these two samples (see Fig~\ref{fig:scaling_relation}). 
    This potential interesting result and its implication is worth more investigations 
    later.  

    Meanwhile, the subtle environmental dependence of \mden{} profiles for the 
    \mtot{}-matched samples suggests that environment does not play the major role in 
    shaping massive galaxies \textbf{at fixed total stellar mass}.
    Therefore it is interesting to ask, for massive galaxies that \textbf{contain 
    similar \mstar{} in the in-situ component}, how does environment affect their 
    subsequent mass assembly?
    Assuming that the \minn{} is reasonable proxy of in-situ mass, we look into this 
    question by comparing the \mden{} profiles of the \minn{}-matched samples ( 
    Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}, right).  
    Although the median \mden{} profiles are similar at $r \leq 10$ kpc, the
    central galaxies in more massive halos clearly possess much more prominent outer
    envelope. 
    This result is robust in a series of statistical and systematical tests 
    (see Appendix~\ref{app:robust}.
    
    At the same time, the uniform slope of the \mden{} profiles within 
    10 kpc is in sharp contrast with the large scatter of the outskirts. 
    It hints that these two regions are shaped by distinctive processes, and may 
    explain their differences in environmental dependency. 
    In simulations, intensive dissipative process helps create 
    self-similar de~Vaucouleur-like ($n{\sim} 4$) \mden{} profile in the inner part 
    of massive galaxy (e.g. \citealt{Hopkins2008}), and the \mhalo{}-dependent
    merging history leads to shallower stellar halo profile for central galaxy 
    of more massive halo (e.g. \citealt{Pillepich2014}). 
    The stochastic nature of the merging process also helps explain the 
    large scatter in the distributions of outer \mden{} profiles. 
    We illustrate this interesting diversity in Fig~\ref{fig:m100_m10_color}, where 
    we show the 3-color images of randomly selected massive central galaxies that 
    have similar \minn{} 
    ($11.1 \leq \log (M_{\star,\ 10\mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) < 11.2$)
    but different \mtot{}.   
    From the top-left to the bottom-right, the \mtot{} of these galaxies increases
    from $10^{11.22} M_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.75} M_{\odot}$.

    \textbf{In summary, we reliably detect subtle, but systematic \mhalo{}-dependence 
    (environmental dependence) of structure in massive central galaxies}, which seems 
    to be consistent with the expectation of more frequent (minor) mergers in denser 
    environment. 
    These minor, non-dissipative mergers do not alter the inner \mden{} profiles 
    a lot, but are efficient in depositing stars to the outer envelope
    (e.g. \citealt{Hilz2013}, \citealt{Oogi2013})      
      
    The median profiles shown in Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1} are available in Table~1.

\subsection{The Environmental Dependence of Scaling Relations}
    \label{ssec:scaling}


\subsubsection{Mass-Size Relation}
    \label{sssec:mass_size}
        
    Despite numerous attempts, previous studies have failed to clearly 
    demonstrate the existence of an environmental dependence of mass-size relation
    at low-$z$ (e.g. \citealt{Weinmann2009, Nair2010, HCompany13, Cerbrian2014}) 
        
    %Despite being the focus of previous investigations (e.g. \citealt{Shankar2013};
    %\citealt{Leja2013}, \citealt{vdWel2014}), the relation between \mstar{} and 
    %effective radius (or half-light radius; $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ or $R_{\mathrm{50}}$) 
    %has yet to provide clear evidence of environmental dependence of structures of 
    %massive galaxies at low-$z$ (e.g. \citealt{Weinmann2009}, \citealt{Nair2010}, 
    %\citealt{HCompany13}, \citealt{Cerbrian2014}), and sent controversial messages 
    %about the pictures at high-$z$ (e.g. \citealt{MCooper2012}, \citealt{Papovich2012}, 
    %\citealt{Kelkar2015}).
    
    By using deep HSC images, and by comparing\mden{} profiles directly, 
    we have shown that the structures of massive galaxies do depend on the masses of 
    their host halos (see the left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:scaling_relation}). 
    We now present our results in terms of the more traditional ``mass-size'' relation. 
    For this purpose, we will use \mtot{} as our ``total'' \mstar{} and the radius 
    enclosing 50\% of luminosity within 100 kpc ($R_{\mathrm{50}}$; derived from the 
    $i$-band curve-of-growth) as our ``size''. 
    This definition of ``effective radius'' is more robust against structural details, 
    choice of model, and the background subtraction. 
    Our massive galaxies are large enough that we do not need to worry about the 
    effects of seeing.
    
    Fig~\ref{fig:scaling_relation} shows the \mstar{}-size relations for both samples. 
    We fit the \logmtot{}-$\log (R_{\mathrm{50}}/\mathrm{kpc})$ relations at 
    \logmtot{}$\geq 11.6$\footnote{We use MCMC and the ensemble sampler 
    \texttt{emcee} (\citealt{Emcee}) with initial guesses are based on maximum 
    likelihood estimates, and we assume reasonable flat priors for parameters.}.
    The best-fit relation for \rbcg{} is:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log (R_{\mathrm{50}}/\mathrm{kpc}) = & (0.73\pm0.13) \times \log (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & -(7.49\pm1.56)
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent And for \nbcg{}, we find:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log (R_{\mathrm{50}}/\mathrm{kpc}) = & (0.68\pm0.06) \times \log (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & -(6.88\pm0.75)
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    
    \noindent As shown in Fig~\ref{fig:scaling_relation}, the slopes of the \mtot{}-size 
    relations are similar between the two samples, but the normalization of the 
    \mtot{}-size relation is different for \rbcg{} compared to \nbcg{}. 
    This result is robust against the ranges of \mstar{}, also the definitions of 
    ``total'' \mstar{} and  half-light radius\footnote{Using \mstar{} within 120 or 150 
    kpc, or using the $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ derived within these apertures will not change 
    the results.}.
    
    We qualitatively compare our results with \citealt{HCompany13} (HC13; green solid line) 
    who studied $z\leq 0.09$ central ETGs in  $14\le$ \logmh{} $<15$ halos. 
    HC13 used the group catalog by \citet{Yang2007} to estimate \mhalo{} after empirically 
    convert their \mstar{} from a Kroupa IMF to a Chabrier IMF by applying a constant 
    -0.05 shift (see \citealt{Bernardi2016}).
    They estimated the 2-D $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ using single-\ser{} model fitting to SDSS 
    images, and derived \mstar{} based on SED fitting using the BC03 (\citealt{BC03}) 
    synthetic population model. 
    We add $+0.1$dex to the HSC13 results to account for the systematic 
    difference between their BC03 and our FSPS model (see Appendix~\ref{app:sed}). 
    The mass-size distributions for both \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies follow the 
    HC13 relation reasonably well (with slightly shallower slopes) even at 
    \logmtot{}$< 11.6$ where our samples start to become incomplete. 
    In contrast to the present study, HC13 finds no halo mass dependence in the 
    mass-size relation for $12.5\le$ \logmh{} $<15.0$ halos.
    A possible explanation for this difference is that the region that strongly depends 
    on halo mass is the low surface brightness outer envelope where the stars are 
    mostly assembled through multiple mergers. 
    This region is difficult to detect on shallow SDSS images, but the much deeper 
    HSC images can provide accurate measurements of total \mstar{} and size. 
     
    In conclusion, we confirm that massive central galaxies at $0.3 < z < 0.5$
    follow \mstar{}-size relations that depend on the masses of their host halos. 
    Central galaxies in denser environment (higher \mhalo{}) have slightly 
    larger $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ comparing to ones in smaller haloes at fixed 
    \mtot{}. 
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
    
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\subsubsection{\mtot{} - \minn{} Relation}
    \label{sssec:m100_m10}
    
    We also investigate the relationship between \mstar{} for two different
    fixed physical apertures (\mtot{} v.s. \minn{}) as alternative tool to help us 
    understand the relationship between \mhalo{} and the assembly history of massive
    galaxies.   
    Comparing to the mass-size relation, this relation is not affected by the 
    ambiguous definition of ``size'', and is much easier to apply to larger samples 
    and to simulations. 
    
    The right panel of Fig \ref{fig:scaling_relation} compares \mtot{} and \minn{}. 
    We find that our \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} occupy different locations within this plane,
    and follow different best-fit \mtot{} - \minn{} relations. 
    For \rbcg{} galaxies we find:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log (M_{\star, 10\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) = & (0.48\pm0.06) \times \log (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & +(5.72\pm0.75).
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    
    \noindent In the same range of \mtot{}, the best-fit relation for \nbcg{} is:
     
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log (M_{\star, 10\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) = & (0.56\pm0.03) \times \log (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & +(4.82\pm0.30).
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    
    We have checked that our results are unchanged if we replace the \minn{} with 
    \mstar{} within 5 or 15 kpc apertures. 
    Although the $M_{\star, 5\ \mathrm{kpc}}$ values are less reliable than \minn{} 
    due to the impacts of seeing, the relation using $M_{\star, 5\ \mathrm{kpc}}$ shows 
    more significant \mhalo{} dependence at the high-mass end.
    Also, best-fit relation using the full \mtot{} range results in even shallower 
    slope for the \rbcg{} galaxies.
     
    Our results suggest that: 
    (1) At fixed \mtot{}, central galaxies in more massive halos tend to have 
    lower fractions of \mstar{} stored in the inner region; 
    (2) For massive galaxies with similar \minn{}, the ones in more massive halos on 
    average have more prominent outer envelopes. 
    The scientific implication of this result is briefly discussed in 
    Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 

    At the same time, we also find \rbcg{} galaxy tends to have lower \mstar{} within 
    inner 5-10 kpc and shallower inner \mden{} profile than the \nbcg{} one at 
    fixed \mtot{}. 
    Although the HSC images do not have sufficient resolution to investigate this in 
    details, it is worth pointing out that this difference could be physically 
    interesting. 
    Observations of compact quiescent galaxies at high-$z$ often reveal higher 
    \mden{} in the central region than their descendants, and certain process need to  
    be responsible for reducing the central \mden{} (e.g. strong adiabatic expansion 
    induced by powerful AGN feedback; \citealt{Fan2008}).
    Coalesce of super-massive black hoes (SMBHs) at the end of major merger, which is 
    common in the assembly history of massive galaxies, can also flatten the central 
    \mden{} profile (e.g. \citealt{Milosavljevi2002}).
    On the right side of Fig \ref{fig:scaling_relation}, we find a few \rbcg{} galaxies 
    with very low \minn{} at high \mtot{} end that are apparently not bothered by 
    problematic photometry or exceptionally bad seeing.  
    They may be similar to the recently discovered massive BCGs with very large core 
    (a few kpc; e.g. \citealt{Postman2012, LopezCruz2014}) resulting from SMBH mergers.
    The impacts of these processes, and their dependence on \mhalo{} is an interesting 
    topic to investigate in the future.

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
    
\subsection{Scatter in Outer Stellar Enveloppes and ``cD'' Galaxies}
        
   The thin lines in Figure \ref{fig:prof_1} show the \mden{} density profiles of 
   individual galaxies. 
   In general, we find that any given galaxy has a relatively smooth profile, even out 
   to large radii, however, on a galax-by-galaxy basis there is a large (but continuous) 
   variation in the amplitude of \mden{} at large scales. 
   Traditionally, the so-called ``cD'' galaxies are defined to have large stellar 
   envelopes and are found at the hearts of massive clusters (\citealt{Matthews1964, 
   Schombert1988}). 
   However, until present, it has not been clear whether ``cD'' galaxies are a distinct 
   and special population, or if they are simply the continum of a smoothly varying 
   population. 
   Fig \ref{fig:prof_1} shows that with the help of our deep HSC images, we can directly 
   map out the variations in \mden{} profiles at large scales. 
   Instead of a bi-model distribution, we find that the outskirts of massive galaxies 
   display a smooth but continuous variation. 
   We can hence conclude that ``cD'' galaxies are simply the extremes of a continuous 
   population but that do not necessarily form a unique a special class of galaxies. 
   This suggests that it might not be very physically meaningful to separate these 
   massive galaxies into two arbitrary morphological classes (``cD'' versus non-``cD''). 
   This conclusion is similar to those of \citep{Zhao2015} who found that a large 
   fraction of nearby BCGs (34\%) does not fall into the ``cD'' class. 
   Our finding that massive galaxies display a diverse range of outer stellar 
   envelope is also supported by HST observations of BCGs at $0.3 < z <0.9$ 
   by \citealt{Bai2014}.
   
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
    
        \item At fixed \mstar{} evaluate within 100 kpc, we find that massive central 
            galaxies display \mden{} profiles that are not self-similar and which 
            present subtle but systematic differences that correlate with \mhalo{}.
            On average, massive central galaxies in more massive halos have slightly 
            shallower inner \mden{} profiles and more prominent outer envelope.
            
        \item We also study how the \mden{} profiles vary with \mhalo{} at fixed 
            ``in-situ'' mass where it is approximated by the \mstar{} within 10 kpc. 
            At fixed \minn{} we find that central galaxies in more massive halos 
            possess much more extended stellar envelope in the outskirts than the ones 
            in smaller halos. 
            At the same time the ellipticity, and optical color profiles inside 10 kpc 
            show little to no dependence on environment.
        
        \item The \mstar{}-size relation also exhibits a clear environmental 
            dependence and central galaxies in more massive halos have larger 
            $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ at fixed \mtot{}. 
            We suggest that the relation between \mtot{} and \minn{}\footnote{or any 
            better proxy of total \mstar{} and the mass formed in the ``in-situ'' phase.} 
            can be a useful tool in diagnosing the assembly history of these massive 
            galaxies and the connection with the assembly of their dark matter halos.
