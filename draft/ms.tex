%%%%%%%%%%%%: Abstract and Keywords %%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{abstract}

  Many recent observations and numerical simulations suggest that nearby
  massive, early-type galaxies are formed through a ``two-phase'' process.  In
  the proposed second phase, the extended stellar envelope was accumulated
  through many dry mergers. (XX TODO)

   Cartoons that illustrate the basic idea of the proposed method for the
   estimation of average merger mass ratio.  The style is adopted from Faber\etal (2007).
   The upper panels show the basic
   picture of the ``two-phase'' formation scenario. The lower panel describes
   a general picture for the evolution of massive galaxies on the
   $M_{\ast}$-color plane.  After massive ETGs were quenched, they quickly
   moved to the red-sequence, and gradually evolved along it as they are
   becoming redder due to the aging of stellar population, and more massive due
   to the accumulation of extended stellar envelope through many minor (dry)
   mergers.  Since the stellar content of smaller system should have lower
   metallicity, the outer envelope naturally has a bluer color compared to inner
   region.  And, such color difference reflects the average mass ratio of all
   mergers that contribute to the second phase of evolution.  Larger color
   difference means more stellar material came from smaller galaxies, hence
   makes minor merger more important.
