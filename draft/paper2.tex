    We use ${\sim}100$ deg$^2$ of deep ($>28.5$ \sb{} in $i$-band), high-quality 
    (0.6\asec seeing) imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey 
    to investigate the halo mass dependence of the surface mass density profiles 
    and outer stellar envelopes of massive galaxies. 
    Our sample consists of ${\sim}7000$ massive (\mstar{}$\geq 11.5$) central galaxies 
    at $0.3 < z < 0.5$. 
    The depth of the HSC survey reaches ${\sim}4$ magnitudes fainter than SDSS and 
    enables us to directly trace stellar mass distributions to 100 kpc without 
    requiring stacking. 
    For the first time, we conclusively show that at fixed stellar mass, massive central 
    galaxies display mass density profiles that are not self similar and which 
    present subtle but systematic differences that correlate with \mhalo{}. 
    On average, massive central galaxies in more massive halos have shallower inner 
    stellar mass density profiles (within ${\sim}10$-$20$ kpc) and more prominent outer 
    envelopes. 
    These differences translate into a clear environmental dependence of the mass-size 
    relation: central galaxies in more massive halos have larger $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ 
    at fixed \mtot{}. 
    Shallow imaging will miss light at the outskirts of galaxies and this has an 
    important impact on measurements of the galaxy mass function. 
    Furthermore, because galaxies in larger halos have more extended envelopes, 
    the amount of light that is missed will be halo mass dependent. 
    Finally, at fixed total stellar mass, there is a large (but continuous) diversity 
    in the amplitude of stellar profiles at 100 kpc. 
    We argue that ``cD'' galaxies represent the tail end of a distribution and 
    are not a distinct class of massive galaxies. 
    Our results are broadly consistent with the two phase formation scenario of 
    massive galaxies in which outer envelopes are built up at late times from the 
    accretion of small systems. 
    Our mass profiles are provided in a convenient tabulated format in order to 
    facilitate comparisons with predictions from numerical simulations of galaxy 
    formation.

\section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:intro}
    
    \jenny{Here is a suggested shorter introduction.}   
    One of the most intriguing observations of high-redshift galaxies from the last decade has 
    been the dramatic size growth in massive quiescent galaxies 
    \citep{Trujillo2006,vanDokkum2008,Damjanov2009,Cimatti2008} of factors of $2-4$ from $z \approx 2$ to the present. 
    These observations have led to a two-phase picture of galaxy growth,
    in which galaxies dissipatively form a central compact region and then their envelope grows around 
    them via dry merging \citep[e.g,][]{Naab2006, Khochfar2006,Oser2010, Oser2012}, which allows for 
    dramatic growth at late times. 
    There is likely also a contribution from progenitor bias, in which larger galaxies become quiescent 
    later \citep[e.g.,][]{Newman2012,XX}. 

	There have been a number of papers testing the two-phase picture observationally at low redshift, 
    looking at the light profiles \citep{Huang2013a,Huang2013b,Oh2017}, color gradients (), 
    and stellar population gradients \citep[e.g.,][]{}. The observations are generically consistent with the 
    two-phase model. However, to really test this picture requires highly sensitive observations extending 
    beyond 10 kpc to truly probe the material accreted at late times \citep[Illustris paper here?][]{}. The surface 
    brightness falls rapidly in the outer parts of elliptical galaxies, making such observations very challenging. In 
    \citet[][; Paper I hereafter]{Huanetal2017}, we showed that the Hyper-Suprime Camera Survey {\bf CITE} allows us 
    to derive robust surface brightness profiles for {\it individual} galaxies out to 100 kpc. 
    
    In Paper I, we exploited this sensitivity to verify that the fraction of accreted mass residing in an extended
    envelope is a function of the mass of the galaxy. Another unexplored issue is the extent to which, at fixed stellar 
    mass, the accreted fraction depends on the surrounding halo mass. According to this two-phase formation 
    scenario, the late time growth of massive ETGs is intrinsically tied to the growth of their host dark matter halos 
    (e.g. \citealt{Leauthaud2012, Behroozi2013, Shankar2013}). 
    Massive ETGs that live at the center of more massive halos should experience 
    a different mass assembly history and should be subject to a larger merger rate 
    compared to ETGs that live in smaller dark matter halos. 
    A natural prediction of the two-phase formation scenario is therefore that the 
    structural properties of massive galaxies should depend on their ``environment''. In this paper, we use our 
    large sample of early-type galaxies, along with halo masses from RedMapper \citep{}, to explore how the mass in
    extended stellar envelopes depends on halo mass. 
    Paper proceeds as follows: XXX.

    \song{This is the old version, needs work}
    Massive galaxies are unique laboratories for studying both cosmology and galaxy 
    formation. 
    Simulations of structure formation within the context of the $\Lambda$-CDM 
    cosmological model make predictions for the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos 
    and galaxies (e.g. \citealt{Baugh1996, DeLucia2006}), but there are many open 
    questions regarding the star-formation history, mass assembly process, and 
    structural evolution of massive galaxies. 
    Massive galaxies are thought to grow according to a ``two-phase'' formation scenario 
    (e.g. \citealt{Oser2010, Oser2012}). 
    In this scenario, the progenitors of $z{\sim} 0$ massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) 
    undergo a rapid growth phase at $z{\sim} 2$ triggered either by disk instabilities 
    or gas rich mergers (e.g. \citealt{Hopkins2008, Dekel2009}). 
    Observationally, the progenitors of ETGs are thought to correspond to the so-called 
    ``red nuggets'' (e.g. \citealt{Damjanov2009}) which have smaller effective radii 
    ($R_{\mathrm{e}}$; e.g. \citealt{Trujillo2006, vanDokkum2008, Cimatti2008}), 
    slightly higher central velocity dispersion and stellar mass density 
    (\mden{}; e.g. \citealt{vandeSande2011, Belli2014}), more disk-like morphologies 
    (e.g. \citealt{vanderWel2011}) than their local descendants 
    (e.g. \citealt{Bezanson2009, vanDokkum2010}).
    
    Following an initial epoch of early formation, feedback from stars and/or AGN 
    (e.g. \citealt{Sijacki2007, Fabian2012}) efficiently quench star formation in 
    massive galaxies and a large fraction of these massive progenitors become quiescent 
    at $z>1$ (e.g. \citealt{Bezanson2009, Kriek2016}). 
    The second phase in the ``two-phase'' formation scenario is driven by 
    non-dissipative processes such as dry mergers with other galaxies 
    (e.g. \citealt{Naab2006, Khochfar2006}). 
    According to the ``two-phase'' scenario, minor mergers drive the growth of massive 
    galaxies at late times and can help explain the significant increase
    of $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ (e.g. \citealt{Newman2012, vdWel2014}) as well as the build-up 
    of the outer stellar halos of ETGs (e.g.  \citealt{Szomoru2012, Patel2013}).         

    {\bf PP here about mass dependence: in the simulations, a larger fraction of the mass 
    is ex-situ at increasingly higher mass. Can we see evidence for that observationally by 
    looking at light profiles?}
   
    In addition, according to this two-phase formation scenario, the late time growth of massive ETGs 
    is intrinsically tied to the growth of their host dark matter halos 
    (e.g. \citealt{Leauthaud2012, Behroozi2013, Shankar2013}). 
    Massive ETGs that live at the center of more massive halos should experience 
    a different mass assembly history and should be subject to a larger merger rate 
    compared to ETGs that live in smaller dark matter halos. 
    A natural prediction of the two-phase formation scenario is therefore that the 
    structural properties of massive galaxies should depend on their ``environment''
    
    In order to truly understand the build-up of the outer parts of massive galaxies, very 
    deep data are needed. Massive ETGs have very steep inner stellar density profiles, 
    extremely extended stellar envelopes, and radial-dependent isophotal shapes which 
    make accurate measurements of \mstar{} and $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ very challenging
    (e.g. \citealt{Bernardi2013, DSouza2014}), 
    especially in the presence of shallow imaging data such as the Sloan Digital Sky 
    Survey (SDSS; e.g. \citealt{SDSSDR7, SDSSDR12}). 
       
    In this paper, we take advantage of new high-resolution (median 
    FWHM${\sim} 0.6^{\arcsec}$ in $i$-band) and deep ($i$-band surface brightness 
    limit $> 28.5$\sb) imaging from the Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic 
    Program \citep[SSP,][]{HSCDR1} to characterize the outer parts of massive galaxies 
    as a function of their properties. Here we will focus on (a) showing that we can 
    measure profiles for galaxies out to 100 kpc reliably with the HSC data and (b) looking at 
    trends in stellar mass and outer envelope properties. In a second paper in this series, we 
    will directly show the environmental dependence of the outer envelope mass.
    %The goal of this paper is to compare the \mden{} profiles and structural scaling 
    %relations of massive central galaxies in both low and high mass dark matter halos. 
    %Fig~\ref{fig:sdss_compare} displays a comparison of the imaging quality of massive 
    %ETGs using SDSS versus using the new HSC data. 
    The deep imaging depth and excellent seeing conditions of HSC images make them 
    perfect for mapping the \mstar{} distributions of massive galaxies out to very 
    large radii. 
    With the help of the \redm{} cluster catalog (e.g.\ \citealt{Rykoff2014}; 
    \citealt{Rozo2015b}; please see Section~\ref{ssec:redmapper} for details), we 
    select a large sample (${\sim} 15000$) of massive central 
    galaxies with $0.3 < z < 0.5$ using ${\sim} 100$ square degree of data from the 
    HSC wide layer.
    
    Motivated by the ``two-phase'' scenario, and also due to the difficulty in 
    providing appropriate model to describe the \mstar{} distribution of massive 
    galaxy from its center to the very outskirt, we focus on \mstar{} within two 
    different physical apertures in this work:
    
    \begin{itemize}
    
        \item The stellar mass within 10 kpc (hereafter noted \minn{}). 
            According to the two-phase scenario, the ``in-situ'' star-formation quickly 
            builds up the inner, dense core of massive ETGs.  
            Based on recent observations and simulations (e.g.~\citealt{vanDokkum2010}; 
            \citealt{RodriguezGomez2016}), the in-situ component of massive ETGs is 
            mostly contained within one effective radius ($R_{\mathrm{e}}$, or 5-10 kpc). 
            We use \minn{} as a proxy for the mass forged during the ``in-situ''
            phase. 
            Given the quality of the HSC data, we can reliably measure \minn{} over our 
            redshift range ($1.0^{\arcsec}$ in radius equals 4.4 and 6.1 kpc at redshift
            0.3 and 0.5).  
            
        \item The stellar mass within 100 kpc (hereafter noted \mtot{}). 
            For our galaxy sample, a 100 kpc aperture corresponds to 5-10 
            $\times R_{\mathrm{e}}$. 
            We show in section \ref{ssec:mtotal} that most of the mass for these ETGs 
            can be captured by a 100 kpc radius and that \mtot{} is a good proxy for the 
            ``total'' \mstar{}. 
            Although not perfect, we argue that our measurements of \mtot{} (which are 
            actually measuring the light directly out to 100 kpc) are a better tracer 
            of total \mstar{} than model-dependent results from shallower data 
            (such as SDSS) which rely on extrapolating the light profiles of galaxies 
            out to large radii.
            
   \end{itemize}
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 

    {\bf We will show the implications for the stellar mass function of including most of 
    the stellar light, a task that has been complicated before now due to shallower data. 
    We will also investigate the idea that the accreted fraction is a function of stellar mass.}
    
    This paper is organized as follows. 
    Section \ref{sec:data} presents our data and our sample selection. 
    Section \ref{sec:ellipse} describes our procedure for extracting 1-D surface 
    brightness profiles. 
    Section \ref{sec:mstar} describes how we estimate stellar mass. 
    Our main results are presented in Section \ref{sec:result} and discussed in 
    Section \ref{sec:discussion}. 
    Section \ref{sec:summary} presents our summary and conclusions.

    Magnitudes use the AB system (\citealt{Oke1983}), and are corrected for Galactic 
    extinction using calibrations from \citet{Schlafly11}.
    In this work, we assume $H_0$ = 70~km~s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, ${\Omega}_{\rm m}=0.3$, 
    and ${\Omega}_{\rm \Lambda}=0.7$.
    Stellar mass is noted \mstar{} and has been derived using a Chabrier Initial Mass 
    Function (IMF; \citealt{Chabrier2003}).     
    $M_{\mathrm{halo}}$ denotes halo mass in general whereas $M_{\rm 200b}$ is 
    explicitly defined as $M_{\rm 200b}\equiv M(<r_{\rm 200b})=200\bar{\rho} 
    \frac{4}{3}\pi r_{\rm 200b}^3$ where $r_{\rm 200b}$
    is the radius at which the mean interior density is equal to 200 times
    the mean matter density ($\bar{\rho}$).

          obtain $\Delta$ from random sub-samples of the data. 
          To compute the grey shaded regions, we first mix the two samples 
          (\rbcg{} and \nbcg{}), then draw sub-samples of galaxies from the mixed 
          population and compute $\Delta$ in the same fashion as for our fiducial signal. 
          We repeat this process 5000 times.  
          The dark-grey shaded region (light-grey shaded region) shows the 1-$\sigma$ 
          (3-$\sigma$) fluctuations in $\Delta$ from these 5000 draws.

\section{Data And Sample Selection}
    \label{sec:data}
    
    \song{Need a much shorter version of HSC data summar here.}
    
    %    The \rbcg{} sample is less affected by completeness because we can utilize 
    %photo-$z$s from \redm{}. 
    %However, the completeness of the \nbcg{} sample is still limited by the 
    %availability of spec-$z$s from BOSS.\alexie{Not sure this is important here.}
    
    \jenny{Here is an attempt to include all the things we really need here.}
    Our sample selection is described in detail in Paper I. Here we include a short summary for completeness. 
    We focus on early-type galaxies with $0.3<z<0.5$ and stellar mass $M_*>10^{11.5}$~\msun. 
    The redshift range includes a large enough volume to have good statistics at the high-mass end, while 
    the stellar mass limit is set by our photometric incompleteness. HSC-identified objects are cross-matched 
    with the spectroscopic and photometric samples from redMapper \citep{Rykoff2014}. Stellar masses are estimated 
    using stellar population synthesis modeling of the broad-band photometry, and then the mass limit is 
    imposed. Using comparisons with published mass functions, we demonstrate that we are complete 
    to $M_*>10^{11.5}$~\msun\ over the full redshift range. 
    
    Finally, here we wish to focus on galaxies that live at the centers of their dark matter halos. 
    We utilize the group information 
    in redMapper v5.10 \citep{Rykoff2014,Rozo2015b} to identify central galaxies. We use the 
    relation between richness $\lambda$ and stellar mass to select groups with 
    $\lambda>30$ or $M_{\rm halo}>10^{14.2}$~\msun\ \citep[e.g.,][]{simetetal2016}. This limit is chosen 
    to mitigate incompleteness at the high end of our redshift window. We then identify the 
    central galaxy to have $P_{\rm CEN}>0.7$. We will refer to this sample of 164 central galaxies as \rbcg{}. The median 
    richness of the sample is $\lambda \approx 41$ ($M_* \approx 2.2 \times 10^{14}$~\msun), and there are 
    only 44 central galaxies in clusters with $\lambda>0.5$ ($M_* > 10^{15}$~\msun). We build a complementary 
    sample of central galaxies in lower-mass halos by calculating the radius of each group with 
    $\lambda>20$ \citep{Diemer2015} and 
    then excluding galaxies within a cylinder around each group, with the thickness of the cylinder broadened to include 
    photo-z uncertainty. The sample of {\bf XX} central galaxies living in halos with $M_* < 10^{14}$~\msun\ will 
    be called \nbcg{}.

\section{Results}
    \label{sec:results}

    %\footnote{There are different observational definitions of ``environment''. 
    %In this paper, we use the term ``environment'' and halo mass interchangeably}.
    
    %Previous work has shown that the half-light radii of massive ETGs is tightly 
    %correlated with \mstar{} (e.g. \citealt{Shen2003, Guo2009}). 
    %Models based on the ``two-phase'' formation scenario naturally predict that this 
    %mass--size relation should exhibit an environmental dependence: the effective radii 
    %of massive ETGs in more massive halos should be larger than those in less massive
    %halos at fixed \mstar{} (e.g. \citealt{Shankar2013, Shankar2014}).
    
    %However, while hints of an environmental dependence in the mass-size relation have 
    %been spotted at high-$z$ (e.g. \citealt{Papovich2012, Lani2013, Delaye2014}; but 
    %also see \citealt{Rettura2010}), there is no solid evidence for this effect at 
    %low-$z$ (e.g. \citealt{Nair2010, HCompany13}; but also see \citealt{Yoon2017}). 
    %The absence of an environmental dependence in the mass-size relation is an 
    %outstanding challenge to the two-phase formation scenario of ETGs.

    \song{These paragraphs are from Jenny's txt file, need organization.}
    Massive central galaxies in this work show an intriguing diversity on the plane 
    defined by these two metrics.  
    We preview this using Fig~\ref{fig:m100_m10_color}, which shows a subsample of 
    massive galaxies at $z{\sim} 0.4$ that share very similar value of \minn{}, but 
    exhibit a large diversity in their outer profiles. 
    Assuming that galaxies at fixed \minn{} share a similar in-situ formation history, 
    it is of great interest to investigate the relation between their present day halo 
    mass and the extend of their outer envelopes. 
    We note that although a circular aperture is shown on Fig~\ref{fig:m100_m10_color}, 
    for our mass measurements, we always use elliptical apertures that follow the 
    average isophotal shape. Finally, given our narrow mass and redshift range, we 
    can safely ignore significant mass growth and structural evolution in this work
    (no star formation, lower merger rate \etal~e.g.\ \citealt{Bellstedt2016},
    \citealt{Inagaki2015}; but also see \citealt{Bai2014}). 

    
    \textbf{Completeness that depends on halo mass:}



    When comparing \nbcg{} and \rbcg{} we will also always make sure that the two 
    samples are well matched both in terms of \mstar{} as well as in terms of redshift. 
    Please see the next section and Appendix~\ref{app:match} for more details.

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\subsection{Environmental Dependence of the Profiles of Massive Galaxies}
    \label{ssec:sbp_mtot} 
       
    We now ask whether or not galaxies from our sample have \mden{} profiles that 
    depend on \mhalo{} (at fixed \mstar{}). 
    For this, we will build matched samples drawing from \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} that are 
    carefully matched in \mstar{} and redshift using a KDTree algorithm 
    (see Appendix~\ref{app:match} and Fig~\ref{fig:match} for details). 
    By matching the redshift distributions within $0.3 < z < 0.5$, we ensure that the 
    \mden{} profiles from both samples are impacted by seeing and background subtraction 
    at similar levels. 
    To match the two samples by stellar mass, we will use two different methods:

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%     
    Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1} compares the profiles of galaxies at fixed \mtot{} and at fixed 
    \minn{} for our two matched samples, and shows the main results of this paper which 
    is that we find a clear halo mass dependence in the \mden{} profiles of massive 
    galaxies. 
    The bottom panel of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1} shows the difference between the two 
    profiles, $\Delta = \log(\mu_{\star, \mathrm{cenHighMh}}) - 
    \log(\mu_{\star, \mathrm{cenLowMh}})$, 
    with errors computed via bootstrap resampling. 
    In Appendix~\ref{app:robust}, we present a variety of tests that verify the 
    robustness of these results against different uncertainties.
   
    There are several important points to be noticed in Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}. 
    First, when galaxies are matched by \mtot{}, although we detect a robust 
    environmental dependence, it mainly only becomes prominent in the outskirts 
    at $R>50$ kpc. 
    This partially explains the difficulties for previous works to detect this effect
    on shallower images. 
    Second, we find that central galaxies in more massive dark mater halos display 
    more flattened inner profile and more significant outer stellar envelope than 
    the ones living in less massive halos. 
    Third, the median \mden{} profiles of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} cross each other 
    at ${\sim} 15$-20 kpc, the expected $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ for ETGs at this \mtot{}. 
    Finally, such systematic difference in structure may become more significant 
    at very high-mass end. 
    We see evidence of this effect when we compare the $Delta$ profiles in two \mtot{} 
    bins (see Fig~\ref{fig:prof_2} and discussion in 
    Appendix~\ref{app:robust})\footnote{Though the lower \mtot{} bin becomes somewhat
    incomplete} and when we discuss the relation between \mtot{} and \minn{} for 
    these two samples (see Fig~\ref{fig:scaling_relation}). 
    This potential interesting result and its implication is worth more investigations 
    later.  

    Meanwhile, the subtle environmental dependence of \mden{} profiles for the 
    \mtot{}-matched samples suggests that environment does not play the major role in 
    shaping massive galaxies \textbf{at fixed total stellar mass}.
    Therefore it is interesting to ask, for massive galaxies that \textbf{contain 
    similar \mstar{} in the in-situ component}, how does environment affect their 
    subsequent mass assembly?
    Assuming that the \minn{} is reasonable proxy of in-situ mass, we look into this 
    question by comparing the \mden{} profiles of the \minn{}-matched samples ( 
    Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}, right).  
    Although the median \mden{} profiles are similar at $r \leq 10$ kpc, the
    central galaxies in more massive halos clearly possess much more prominent outer
    envelope. 
    This result is robust in a series of statistical and systematical tests 
    (see Appendix~\ref{app:robust}.
    
    At the same time, the uniform slope of the \mden{} profiles within 
    10 kpc is in sharp contrast with the large scatter of the outskirts. 
    It hints that these two regions are shaped by distinctive processes, and may 
    explain their differences in environmental dependency. 
    In simulations, intensive dissipative process helps create 
    self-similar de~Vaucouleur-like ($n{\sim} 4$) \mden{} profile in the inner part 
    of massive galaxy (e.g. \citealt{Hopkins2008}), and the \mhalo{}-dependent
    merging history leads to shallower stellar halo profile for central galaxy 
    of more massive halo (e.g. \citealt{Pillepich2014}). 
    The stochastic nature of the merging process also helps explain the 
    large scatter in the distributions of outer \mden{} profiles. 
    We illustrate this interesting diversity in Fig~\ref{fig:m100_m10_color}, where 
    we show the 3-color images of randomly selected massive central galaxies that 
    have similar \minn{} 
    ($11.1 \leq \log (M_{\star,\ 10\mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) < 11.2$)
    but different \mtot{}.   
    From the top-left to the bottom-right, the \mtot{} of these galaxies increases
    from $10^{11.22} M_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.75} M_{\odot}$.

    \textbf{In summary, we reliably detect subtle, but systematic \mhalo{}-dependence 
    (environmental dependence) of structure in massive central galaxies}, which seems 
    to be consistent with the expectation of more frequent (minor) mergers in denser 
    environment. 
    These minor, non-dissipative mergers do not alter the inner \mden{} profiles 
    a lot, but are efficient in depositing stars to the outer envelope
    (e.g. \citealt{Hilz2013}, \citealt{Oogi2013})      
      
    The median profiles shown in Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1} are available in Table~1.

\subsection{The Environmental Dependence of Scaling Relations}
    \label{ssec:scaling}

\subsubsection{Mass-Size Relation}
    \label{sssec:mass_size}
        
    Despite numerous attempts, previous studies have failed to clearly 
    demonstrate the existence of an environmental dependence of mass-size relation
    at low-$z$ (e.g. \citealt{Weinmann2009, Nair2010, HCompany13, Cerbrian2014}) 
        
    %Despite being the focus of previous investigations (e.g. \citealt{Shankar2013};
    %\citealt{Leja2013}, \citealt{vdWel2014}), the relation between \mstar{} and 
    %effective radius (or half-light radius; $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ or $R_{\mathrm{50}}$) 
    %has yet to provide clear evidence of environmental dependence of structures of 
    %massive galaxies at low-$z$ (e.g. \citealt{Weinmann2009}, \citealt{Nair2010}, 
    %\citealt{HCompany13}, \citealt{Cerbrian2014}), and sent controversial messages 
    %about the pictures at high-$z$ (e.g. \citealt{MCooper2012}, \citealt{Papovich2012}, 
    %\citealt{Kelkar2015}).
    
    By using deep HSC images, and by comparing\mden{} profiles directly, 
    we have shown that the structures of massive galaxies do depend on the masses of 
    their host halos (see the left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:scaling_relation}). 
    We now present our results in terms of the more traditional ``mass-size'' relation. 
    For this purpose, we will use \mtot{} as our ``total'' \mstar{} and the radius 
    enclosing 50\% of luminosity within 100 kpc ($R_{\mathrm{50}}$; derived from the 
    $i$-band curve-of-growth) as our ``size''. 
    This definition of ``effective radius'' is more robust against structural details, 
    choice of model, and the background subtraction. 
    Our massive galaxies are large enough that we do not need to worry about the 
    effects of seeing.
    
    Fig~\ref{fig:scaling_relation} shows the \mstar{}-size relations for both samples. 
    We fit the \logmtot{}-$\log (R_{\mathrm{50}}/\mathrm{kpc})$ relations at 
    \logmtot{}$\geq 11.6$\footnote{We use MCMC and the ensemble sampler 
    \texttt{emcee} (\citealt{Emcee}) with initial guesses are based on maximum 
    likelihood estimates, and we assume reasonable flat priors for parameters.}.
    The best-fit relation for \rbcg{} is:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log (R_{\mathrm{50}}/\mathrm{kpc}) = & (0.73\pm0.13) \times \log (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & -(7.49\pm1.56)
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent And for \nbcg{}, we find:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log (R_{\mathrm{50}}/\mathrm{kpc}) = & (0.68\pm0.06) \times \log (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & -(6.88\pm0.75)
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    
    \noindent As shown in Fig~\ref{fig:scaling_relation}, the slopes of the \mtot{}-size 
    relations are similar between the two samples, but the normalization of the 
    \mtot{}-size relation is different for \rbcg{} compared to \nbcg{}. 
    This result is robust against the ranges of \mstar{}, also the definitions of 
    ``total'' \mstar{} and  half-light radius\footnote{Using \mstar{} within 120 or 150 
    kpc, or using the $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ derived within these apertures will not change 
    the results.}.
    
    We qualitatively compare our results with \citealt{HCompany13} (HC13; green solid line) 
    who studied $z\leq 0.09$ central ETGs in  $14\le$ \logmh{} $<15$ halos. 
    HC13 used the group catalog by \citet{Yang2007} to estimate \mhalo{} after empirically 
    convert their \mstar{} from a Kroupa IMF to a Chabrier IMF by applying a constant 
    -0.05 shift (see \citealt{Bernardi2016}).
    They estimated the 2-D $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ using single-\ser{} model fitting to SDSS 
    images, and derived \mstar{} based on SED fitting using the BC03 (\citealt{BC03}) 
    synthetic population model. 
    We add $+0.1$dex to the HSC13 results to account for the systematic 
    difference between their BC03 and our FSPS model (see Appendix~\ref{app:sed}). 
    The mass-size distributions for both \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies follow the 
    HC13 relation reasonably well (with slightly shallower slopes) even at 
    \logmtot{}$< 11.6$ where our samples start to become incomplete. 
    In contrast to the present study, HC13 finds no halo mass dependence in the 
    mass-size relation for $12.5\le$ \logmh{} $<15.0$ halos.
    A possible explanation for this difference is that the region that strongly depends 
    on halo mass is the low surface brightness outer envelope where the stars are 
    mostly assembled through multiple mergers. 
    This region is difficult to detect on shallow SDSS images, but the much deeper 
    HSC images can provide accurate measurements of total \mstar{} and size. 
     
    In conclusion, we confirm that massive central galaxies at $0.3 < z < 0.5$
    follow \mstar{}-size relations that depend on the masses of their host halos. 
    Central galaxies in denser environment (higher \mhalo{}) have slightly 
    larger $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ comparing to ones in smaller haloes at fixed 
    \mtot{}. 
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
    
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\subsubsection{\mtot{} - \minn{} Relation}
    \label{sssec:m100_m10}
    
    We also investigate the relationship between \mstar{} for two different
    fixed physical apertures (\mtot{} v.s. \minn{}) as alternative tool to help us 
    understand the relationship between \mhalo{} and the assembly history of massive
    galaxies.   
    Comparing to the mass-size relation, this relation is not affected by the 
    ambiguous definition of ``size'', and is much easier to apply to larger samples 
    and to simulations. 
    
    The right panel of Fig \ref{fig:scaling_relation} compares \mtot{} and \minn{}. 
    We find that our \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} occupy different locations within this plane,
    and follow different best-fit \mtot{} - \minn{} relations. 
    For \rbcg{} galaxies we find:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log (M_{\star, 10\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) = & (0.48\pm0.06) \times \log (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & +(5.72\pm0.75).
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    
    \noindent In the same range of \mtot{}, the best-fit relation for \nbcg{} is:
     
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log (M_{\star, 10\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) = & (0.56\pm0.03) \times \log (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & +(4.82\pm0.30).
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    
    We have checked that our results are unchanged if we replace the \minn{} with 
    \mstar{} within 5 or 15 kpc apertures. 
    Although the $M_{\star, 5\ \mathrm{kpc}}$ values are less reliable than \minn{} 
    due to the impacts of seeing, the relation using $M_{\star, 5\ \mathrm{kpc}}$ shows 
    more significant \mhalo{} dependence at the high-mass end.
    Also, best-fit relation using the full \mtot{} range results in even shallower 
    slope for the \rbcg{} galaxies.
     
    Our results suggest that: 
    (1) At fixed \mtot{}, central galaxies in more massive halos tend to have 
    lower fractions of \mstar{} stored in the inner region; 
    (2) For massive galaxies with similar \minn{}, the ones in more massive halos on 
    average have more prominent outer envelopes. 
    The scientific implication of this result is briefly discussed in 
    Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 

    At the same time, we also find \rbcg{} galaxy tends to have lower \mstar{} within 
    inner 5-10 kpc and shallower inner \mden{} profile than the \nbcg{} one at 
    fixed \mtot{}. 
    Although the HSC images do not have sufficient resolution to investigate this in 
    details, it is worth pointing out that this difference could be physically 
    interesting. 
    Observations of compact quiescent galaxies at high-$z$ often reveal higher 
    \mden{} in the central region than their descendants, and certain process need to  
    be responsible for reducing the central \mden{} (e.g. strong adiabatic expansion 
    induced by powerful AGN feedback; \citealt{Fan2008}).
    Coalesce of super-massive black hoes (SMBHs) at the end of major merger, which is 
    common in the assembly history of massive galaxies, can also flatten the central 
    \mden{} profile (e.g. \citealt{Milosavljevi2002}).
    On the right side of Fig \ref{fig:scaling_relation}, we find a few \rbcg{} galaxies 
    with very low \minn{} at high \mtot{} end that are apparently not bothered by 
    problematic photometry or exceptionally bad seeing.  
    They may be similar to the recently discovered massive BCGs with very large core 
    (a few kpc; e.g. \citealt{Postman2012, LopezCruz2014}) resulting from SMBH mergers.
    The impacts of these processes, and their dependence on \mhalo{} is an interesting 
    topic to investigate in the future.

\subsection{Scatter in Outer Stellar Enveloppes and ``cD'' Galaxies}
        
   The thin lines in Figure \ref{fig:prof_1} show the \mden{} density profiles of 
   individual galaxies. 
   In general, we find that any given galaxy has a relatively smooth profile, even out 
   to large radii, however, on a galax-by-galaxy basis there is a large (but continuous) 
   variation in the amplitude of \mden{} at large scales. 
   Traditionally, the so-called ``cD'' galaxies are defined to have large stellar 
   envelopes and are found at the hearts of massive clusters (\citealt{Matthews1964, 
   Schombert1988}). 
   However, until present, it has not been clear whether ``cD'' galaxies are a distinct 
   and special population, or if they are simply the continum of a smoothly varying 
   population. 
   Fig \ref{fig:prof_1} shows that with the help of our deep HSC images, we can directly 
   map out the variations in \mden{} profiles at large scales. 
   Instead of a bi-model distribution, we find that the outskirts of massive galaxies 
   display a smooth but continuous variation. 
   We can hence conclude that ``cD'' galaxies are simply the extremes of a continuous 
   population but that do not necessarily form a unique a special class of galaxies. 
   This suggests that it might not be very physically meaningful to separate these 
   massive galaxies into two arbitrary morphological classes (``cD'' versus non-``cD''). 
   This conclusion is similar to those of \citep{Zhao2015} who found that a large 
   fraction of nearby BCGs (34\%) does not fall into the ``cD'' class. 
   Our finding that massive galaxies display a diverse range of outer stellar 
   envelope is also supported by HST observations of BCGs at $0.3 < z <0.9$ 
   by \citealt{Bai2014}.

   \song{This part is directly copied from Jenny's txt file, not the right place.}    
   \begin{itemize}
   
         \item At fixed \mstar{} evaluate within 100 kpc, we find that massive central 
            galaxies display \mden{} profiles that are not self-similar and which 
            present subtle but systematic differences that correlate with \mhalo{}.
            On average, massive central galaxies in more massive halos have slightly 
            shallower inner \mden{} profiles and more prominent outer envelope.
            
        \item We also study how the \mden{} profiles vary with \mhalo{} at fixed 
            ``in-situ'' mass where it is approximated by the \mstar{} within 10 kpc. 
            At fixed \minn{} we find that central galaxies in more massive halos 
            possess much more extended stellar envelope in the outskirts than the ones 
            in smaller halos. 
            At the same time the ellipticity, and optical color profiles inside 10 kpc 
            show little to no dependence on environment.
        
        \item The \mstar{}-size relation also exhibits a clear environmental 
            dependence and central galaxies in more massive halos have larger 
            $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ at fixed \mtot{}. 
            We suggest that the relation between \mtot{} and \minn{}\footnote{or any 
            better proxy of total \mstar{} and the mass formed in the ``in-situ'' phase.} 
            can be a useful tool in diagnosing the assembly history of these massive 
            galaxies and the connection with the assembly of their dark matter halos.

\section{Discussion}
    \label{sec:discussion}
    
    \song{Keep the relevant session from previous draft, need some works.}
    By using deep imaging from the HSC survey we have shown that the stellar mass 
    density profiles of massive central galaxies depend systematically on the mass 
    of their host dark matter halos. 
    Here we discuss the physical origin, scientific implications, and potential 
    caveats of this result. 
    
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
    
\subsection{The ``Two phase'' Formation Scenario of Massive Galaxies and the 
            Build-Up of Outer Envelopes}
            
    Our results are consistent with the picture that massive central galaxies form via 
    a ``two-phase'' scenario. 
    According to this theory, the cores of massive galaxies were formed at $z{\sim} 2$ 
    during an intense period of in-situ star formation. 
    The outskirts of massive galaxies are then built up via a more gradual second 
    phase of evolution (the ``ex-situ'' phase) which is dominated by mass growth via 
    the accretion of satellite systems. 
    Non-dissipative minor mergers mostly deposit stars on the outskirts of the 
    centrals and do not have large impact on the central \mden{} profile 
    (e.g. \citealt{Oogi2013, Bedorf2013}). 
    Hence, according to this picture, the outer stellar envelopes of massive centrals 
    should correlate with the masses of their host halos, in qualitative agreement with
    our findings. 
          
    State of the art hydrodynamic simulations suggest that massive dark matter halos 
    have central galaxies that have outer stellar envelopes with shallow slopes 
    (e.g. \citealt{Pillepich2014}). 
    This is consistent with the results in Fig \ref{fig:prof_1}.
     
    Meanwhile, these simulation also point out that the fraction of accreted stars 
    increases steeply with total \mstar{} and that the ``ex-situ'' component
    starts to dominate the \mden{} profiles around $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ for 
    \logms{}$\geq 11.5$ galaxies. 
    In this work, we find that the median \mden{} profiles of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} 
    samples start to show differences around 15-20 kpc, which is close to 
    their $R_{\mathrm{e}}$. 
    Furthermore, the environmental dependence of our median \mden{} profiles 
    becomes more significant in our highest \mtot{} bin (see Fig \ref{fig:prof_4}). 
    These results all align with the picture that the \mhalo{}-dependence of the 
    \mden{} profiles of massive galaxies is driven by the variations in the 
    ``ex-situ'' component at large radii. 
   
    We now investigate to what degree our assumption that the inner 10 kpc \mstar{}
    corresponds to an in-situ mass.    
    Fig \ref{fig:discussion_1} compares the median \mden{} profiles of the 
    galaxies in two \mtot{} bins 
    ($11.4\leq$\logmtot{}$<11.6$ and $11.6\leq$\logmtot{}$<11.8$) with 
    (1) the median \mden{} profiles of massive ETGs at $1.0 < z < 1.5$ in
    \citealt{Patel2013} since they are considered as the progenitors of 
    ${\sim} 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$ ETGs at $z=0$.    
    (2) the inner components of $z{\sim} 0$ ellipticals from 2-D decomposition 
    (\citealt{Huang2013a}).
    As proxy of the in-situ components, \citet{Huang2013b} showed they are 
    structurally similar to the compact ``red nuggets'' at high-$z$. 
    (3) the ``in-situ'' components of simulated central galaxies in massive halos 
    from \citet{Cooper13} (the inner ${\sim} 5$ kpc is quite uncertain due to the 
    resolution).  
    The comparison confirms that \minn{} should be reasonable proxy of the 
    ``in-situ'' mass\footnote{We convert these \mden{} profiles to the same 
    Chabrier IMF; but there are still differences in median \mstar{} and 
    details in the \m2l{} estimates}.  
    More importantly, it shows that the \mden{} profile at 
    $\mathrm{R} > 15$-20 kpc is likely dominated by stars that are not related 
    to the ``in-situ'' processes.  
    
    We also compare with a uniquely massive BCG at high redshift: 
    a ${\sim} 10^{11.4} M_{\odot}$ BCG with distinctive ``cD''-like envelope at 
    $z{\sim} 1.1$ (\citealt{Liu2013}).  
    Its \mden{} profile follows the median profile of $11.6\leq$\logmtot{}$<11.8$ 
    massive galaxies nicely inside 10-15 kpc, but becomes much steeper in the outskirt.  
    This unique object may present an interesting case where the inner ``core'' of a 
    massive BCGs is already in pace at $z{\sim} 1$ when its extended envelope is still
    under construction.
    More BCGs like this at $0.5 < z < 1.0$ can shed light on this intriguing 
    process, and help us confirm whether the environmental dependence of structure 
    has already emerged within massive galaxies at higher redshift 
    (e.g. \citealt{Papovich2012})

\section{Summary and Conclusions}
    \label{sec:summary}

    \song{From old draft, need some works}
    
    In this work, we study how environment (halo mass) affects the stellar mass density 
    profiles of massive central galaxies using deep images from the Subaru HSC 
    survey. 
    With the help of this high-quality and wide area data set, we directly map the 
    stellar mass distributions of ${\sim}7000$ massive central galaxies at 
    $0.3 < z < 0.5$ out to $>100$ kpc without resorting to stacking techniques. 
    We group massive central galaxies into two categories based on their host halo 
    mass (\mhalo{}$\simgt 10^{14.2} M_{\odot}$ and \mhalo{}$\simlt 10^{14} M_{\odot}$). 
    Our main results are:  
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We find that the ``total'' \mstar{} of these massive galaxies can be 
            significantly underestimated with shallow imaging data such as SDSS and/or 
            imperfect model assumption (e.g. the \texttt{cModel} or single-\ser{}) 
            are used. 
            In contrast to previous work, our results do not depend on stacking or any 
            parametric models. 
            Moreover, the level of such underestimation could also depend on the 
            stellar mass and on halo mass. 
            This should be carefully taken into account when discussing topics such 
            as the evolution of the galaxy SMF.
            
        \item We show that the \mden{} profiles of massive galaxies are generally quite 
            smooth out to 10 kpc but that there is a large but continuous scatter in the 
            amount of light in their outskirts. 
            {\bf KEEP? We argue that ``cD'' galaxies simply represent the tail end of a 
            distribution but that they are not a distinct class of massive galaxies.}
            
        \item {\bf How do profiles depend on Mstar?}
            
    \end{enumerate}

    These results highlight the advantages of wide area, deep, and high-quality imaging 
    for studying the evolution of massive galaxies. 
    Upon finishing this work, the HSC survey has already doubled its sky coverage to 
    ${\sim} 200$ deg$^2$, and provides a much larger sample of massive central galaxies. 
    In the near future, we will extend this work to lower \mtot{} by using photometric 
    redshifts, and we will also apply 2-D photometry method (e.g.\ \citealt{Huang2013a}) 
    to take advantages of the multi-wavelength nature of the HSC survey 
    (e.g. \citealt{Huang2016}). 
    Our current work can also be combined with weak lensing measurements of the dark 
    matter halos of massive galaxies and physical insights into the assembly histories 
    of these galaxies can be gained by comparing with cosmological hydro-simulations 
    such as Illustris (\citealt{Vogelsberger2014}, \citealt{Genel2014}), 
    EAGLE (\citealt{Schaye2015}, \citealt{Crain2015}), or \textit{Horizon-AGN} 
    (\citealt{Dubois2014}).

\section{A. Comparison of \mden{} profiles using \mstar{} from the GAMA survey}
    \label{app:gama} 

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/redbcg_prof_gama_new}
    \caption{
        \textbf{Left:} comparison of \mstar{} estimated by the GAMA survey and 
        the \mtot{} using HSC images in this work. 
        We plot the \logmgama{} against the difference between \logmtot{} and \logmgama{}. 
        The format is very similar to the left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:smf1}. 
        The two vertical lines highlight the mass range $11.4 \leq$\logmgama{}$<11.8$ 
        that is used for the comparison.~~
        \textbf{Right:} we compare the \mden{} profiles of \rbcg{} (orange-red) and 
        \nbcg{} (grey-black) galaxies using the samples matched on the 
        \mgama{}-$z$ plane at $11.4 \leq$\logmgama{}$<11.9$ and $0.28 \leq z < 0.4$. 
        The format is very similar to the ones in Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}.}
    \label{fig:gama}
\end{figure*}
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 

    The GAMA survey greatly overlaps with the HSC survey, and it provides carefully 
    measured \mstar{} for large sample of galaxies (\citealt{Taylor2011}) that help 
    produce many interesting results (e.g. \citealt{Bauer2013, Ferreras2017}).
    They use 2-D single-\ser{} model to correct the total luminosity of the galaxy 
    (\citealt{Kelvin2012}), and derive the \m2l{} through optical-SED fitting 
    (BC03 model; Chabrier IMF) based on the PSF-matched aperture photometry. 
    Since the \ser{} model is generally more flexible than the \texttt{cModel} one, 
    it is therefore interesting to compare with the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies 
    that also have spec-$z$ (at $z < 0.40$) and \mstar{} in GAMA DR2 
    (\citealt{Liske2015}) and see the impact of deep photometry again. 
    
    We summarize the results in Fig~\ref{fig:gama}.  
    On the left panel, we compare the differences between \mtot{} and \mgama{}. 
    HSC survey on average recovers more \mstar{} at high-\mstar{} end, which is 
    consistent with the expectation from deeper photometry, although the 
    systematic differences in the estimates of \m2l{} could play a role here. 
    Meanwhile, it is interesting see that, above \logmtot{}$> 11.8$, \mgama{} 
    becomes increasingly larger than \mtot{}, and most of these massive 
    galaxies have very high \ser{} index from the 2-D fitting. 
    This suggests that the single-\ser{} model is no longer an appropriate one to 
    describe very massive galaxies as it tends to over-estimate the \mstar{} the 
    inner and/or outer regions. 
    
    To verify the cause of the difference in \mstar{}, we further select samples 
    of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies with matched \mgama{} and redshift 
    distributions (at $11.4 <$\logmgama{}$<11.8$; see Appendix \ref{app:match}), 
    and compare their \mden{} profiles (right panel). 
    Although these two subsamples are equally massive according to results from 
    GAMA survey, it is clear that the \rbcg{} galaxy has much more extended 
    outer envelope, even though its median \mden{} profile is very similar 
    to the \nbcg{} sample at $< 10$ kpc. 
    We can reproduce very the same trend with the luminosity density profiles 
    (with or without $k$-correction), suggesting that the inaccurate \ser{} 
    model definitely leads to under-estimate of \mstar{}.

\section{B. Comparisons of \mden{} profiles in different redshift bins}
    \label{app:redshift}

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\begin{figure}
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=8.2cm]{fig/redbcg_avg_prof_z}
    \caption{
        Comparison of \mden{} profiles of \rbcg{} (orange-red) and \nbcg{} 
        (grey-black) at $11.6 \le$\logmtot$< 11.9$ in redshift bins of 
        $0.3\leq z<0.4$ (solid lines) and $0.4\leq z<0.5$ (dash lines). 
        We show the individual profile in the background using much thinner line, 
        and highlight the median profiles using thicker line and darker color.
        Other formats are exactly the same with the left figure of 
        Fig~\ref{fig:avg_prof}.}
    \label{fig:avg_prof_z}
\end{figure}    
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
    
    Given the redshift range for our samples, it is important to evaluate 
    the impacts from the physical extend of seeing and the imaging depth on the \mden{} 
    profiles at different redshift. 
    Under the same seeing, the \mden{} profile of galaxy at higher-$z$ is more 
    vulnerable to the PSF smearing effect at the center. 
    It is also harder to reach to the same \mden{} level under the same imaging depth 
    due to cosmological dimming and background noise. 
    
    In Fig~\ref{fig:avg_prof_z}, we group the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies within 
    $11.6 \le$\logmtot$< 11.9$ into two $z$ bins ($0.3\leq z<0.4$ and $0.4\leq z<0.5$),
    and compare their \mden{} profiles. 
    In two redshift bins, the median \mden{} profiles from the same sample follow each 
    other very well outside 10 kpc, but become visibly different in the central 3-4 kpc,
    where the effect from seeing kicks in. 
    Meanwhile, the median \mden{} profiles of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} in the same $z$ bin 
    are identical in the central region, which indicates similar average seeing 
    conditions.       
    This confirms that \mden{} profile at $> 5$ kpc is safe from the impacts of seeing 
    and difference in redshift.
    More importantly, it also suggests that, once the redshift distributions are 
    carefully matched, the difference of \mden{} profile is likely to be physical 
    even in the central region.

\section{C. Match the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} samples in \mstar{} and redshift distributions}
    \label{app:match}

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\begin{figure*}
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/redbcg_match}
    \caption{
        \textbf{Left figure} shows the details of the \mtot{}-matching process, 
        corresponding to the results shown in the left figure of   
        On the top panel, we show the overall distributions of \rbcg{} (light orange boxes) 
        and \nbcg{} (light grey dots) galaxies on the \mtot{}-$z$ plane.  
        And, we match the two sample in the \mtot{}-$z$ space outlined by the shaded region.
        We highlight the \rbcg{} galaxies in this region using bigger boxes in red frames, 
        whose size reflects the $P_{\mathrm{Cen}}$ value.  
        We also color-code them using the richness ($\lambda$) of the host cluster. 
        The matched \nbcg{} galaxies are highlighted using darker color and bigger dots. 
        To further evaluate the matching results, we show the distributions of \mtot{} 
        (middle panel) and redshift (bottom panel) separately. 
        On both panesl, we show the histograms along with their kernel density 
        distributions.  
        And, on the top of each panel, two sets of short vertical lines highlight the median 
        value (solid) and the inter-quartile (dash) of each distribution.~~~
        \textbf{Right figure} shows the similar matching results for the \minn{}-matched
        samples used for the right figure of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}.
        The format is exactly the same as the left one, except the \minn{} replaces the 
        \mtot{} in the top and middle panels.}
    \label{fig:match}
\end{figure*}
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
    
    As explained earlier, it is important to make sure the two samples have similar 
    distributions in both \mstar{} and redshift before comparing their median \mden{} 
    profiles.  
    Here we briefly describe the procedure used in this work. 
    Since the \rbcg{} sample is smaller in size, we always match the \nbcg{} sample to 
    it by searching for the $N$-nearest neighbours on the $M_{\star}$-redshift plane 
    using the KDTree algorithm in the \texttt{scikit-learn} Python library 
    (\citealt{scikit-learn}), and evaluate the quality of the match using the 
    distributions of both parameters (as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:match}). 
 
    As we only keep the unique \nbcg{} galaxies in the matched sample, we manually 
    adjust the value of $N$ to achieve the best match. 
    When the redshift distribution of the \rbcg{} sample becomes bi-model, we also try 
    to split the sample into two redshift bins and match them separately. 
    Typically $N$ is between 3 to 8.
    In Fig~\ref{fig:match}, we demonstrate this procedure using the results for 
    the \mtot{}-matched (Left) and the \minn{}-matched samples in Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}
    (Right), and the two samples are well matched in the distributions of \mtot{}
    (or \minn{}) and redshift.  
    For all the comparisons of \mden{} profiles in this work, we match the samples 
    in the same way, and make sure the match has the same quality. 
    
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\section{D. Robustness of the \mden{} Differences} 
	\label{app:robust}
    
    In Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}, we compare the \mden{} profiles of \mtot{}- and 
    \minn{}-matched samples of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies, and here we test the 
    robustness of the results using a few extra tests that are illustrated in
    Fig~\ref{fig:prof_2}, Fig~\ref{fig:prof_3}, and Fig~\ref{fig:prof_4}, and 
    are briefly described here:   
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        
        \item In Fig~\ref{fig:prof_2}, we group the samples into two \mtot{} bins. 
            Given the small sample size, we extend slightly toward lower \mtot{} range 
            ($11.5 \leq \log (M_{\star,\ 10\mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) < 11.7$ and 
             $11.7 \leq \log (M_{\star,\ 10\mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) < 11.9$). 
            Although the smaller sample leads to larger statistical uncertainties, 
            we can still see similar structural differences in both \mtot{} bins, 
            and the difference becomes more significant in the higher \mtot{} bin.  
            For the lower \mtot{} bin, the difference in the inner region becomes 
            quite uncertain, while the difference in the outskirt is still visible. 
            This potentially suggests that the environmental dependence of structure 
            also varies with \mstar{}, an important implication deserves more 
            investigations in the future.   

        \item On the left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_3}, we match the \rbcg{} and 
            \nbcg{} samples in a lower redshift bins ($0.30 < z < 0.42$).
            Despite the larger uncertainties due to smaller samples, we find the 
            results are the same.
            
        \item On the middle panel of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_3}, we includes \rbcg{} 
            galaxies in poorer clusters ($20 < \lambda < 30$), which should result 
            in overlapped \mhalo{} distributions with the \nbcg{} samples 
            considering the typical uncertainty of $\lambda$.
            This makes the difference in the inner region slightly less significant, 
            but the overall results are the same. 
             
        \item On the right panel of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_3}, in stead of using \mtot{}, 
            we use the \mmax{}--the maximum \mstar{} by integrating the \mden{} 
            profiles to the largest radius allowed.  
            The \mmax{} values are less reliable than \mtot{} due to the 
            uncertainty of background subtraction and contamination from nearby 
            bright objects, but they can serve as different estimates of the ``total''
            \mstar{} of these galaxies.
            As shown in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}, they on average increase
            the \mstar{} by a little bit and affect the \rbcg{} more.
            The differences in the \mden{} profiles still remain very similar.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
    We also test the robustness of the \mtot{}-matched results using the samples with 
    only spectroscopic redshift, the samples in the three GAMA fields, and the \rbcg{} 
    samples without the ones in very massive halos ($\lambda > 40$).  
    Limited by space, we do not show these results here, but they all verify the 
    robustness of the results. 
    
    For the results from the \minn{}-matched samples: 
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    
        \item
            We match the two samples using both \minn{} and the \mstar{} within 15 kpc 
            at the same time.  
            This makes the two median \mden{} profiles very similar inside 10-15 
            kpc, while the result in the outskirt remains the same (left panel of 
            Fig~\ref{fig:prof_4}).
            Use \mstar{} within 5 or 20 kpc leads to the same conclusion. 
          
        \item 
            To make sure the two samples are comparable in their overall assembly history,
            we also try to only include the very massive galaxies (\logmtot{}$>11.5$)
            in both samples. 
            This excludes the \nbcg{} galaxies that are much less massive and 
            more ``compact'' in structure. 
            Yet, the results regarding the structural differences remain the same. 
          
    \end{enumerate}
