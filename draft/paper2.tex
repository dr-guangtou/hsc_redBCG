\begin{abstract} 
    
    In \citet{hscMassiveI}, we use deep ($>28.5$ \sb{} in $i$-band), high-quality 
    (0.6\asec seeing) images of ${\sim}3000$ massive (\mstar{}$\geq 11.5$) central 
    galaxies at $0.3 < z < 0.5$ from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program 
    to show that more massive central galaxies display more prominent stellar haloes 
    with shallower outer stellar mass density profile (\mden) and higher ellipticity. 
    In this work, we investigate the environment dependence of stellar mass 
    distributions of massive central galaxies using the same dataset.
    Treating stellar mass within a 100 kpc elliptical aperture (\mtot{}) as proxy of 
    total stellar mass, we show that at fixed \mtot{}, massive central galaxies in 
    \mhalo{}$\geq 10^{14}$\msun{} haloes show slightly shallower \mden{} profiles, 
    larger half-light radius, and lower fraction of stellar mass within inner 10 kpc 
    (\minn{}) than the centrals of \mhalo{}$< 10^{14}$\msun{} haloes. 
    At fixed \minn{}--a tracer of the \textit{in situ} stellar mass, central galaxies 
    from more massive haloes host much more significant outer stellar haloes despite 
    their inner \mden{} profiles are very similar with the ones in less massive haloes.
    These results clearly demonstrate that mass--size relation for central galaxies 
    indeed depends on environment at high-\mtot{} end. 
    We also show that the \mtot{}--\minn{} relation can reflect this dependence 
    better and can help diagnose the assembly of massive galaxies and their haloes.
    These results suggest more massive haloes favor more efficient growth of stellar 
    haloes in their central galaxies, which is broadly consistent with the two phase 
    formation scenario of massive galaxies in which their outer envelopes are 
    accumulated through accretions of small systems.

\section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:intro}
    
    One of the most intriguing observations of high-redshift galaxies from the last 
    decade has been the dramatic structural transformation in massive quiescent 
    galaxies \citep[e.g.][]{Trujillo2006, vanDokkum2008, Cimatti2008, Damjanov2009, 
    vanderWel2011, Szomoru2012, Patel2013} from $z \approx 2$ to the present. 
    These observations suggest that the progenitors of $z{\sim} 0$ massive early-type 
    galaxies (ETGs) need to increase their effective radius ($R_{\rm e}$) by factor 
    of 2--4 in the last 10 Gyrs (e.g. \citealt{Newman2012, vdWel2014}).
    They have led to a ``two-phase'' scenario for the formation of massive ETGs 
    (e.g. \citealt{Oser2010, Oser2012}),
    in which galaxies form a compact central region through highly dissipative 
    processes (e.g. gas-rich merger or cold gas-accretion; 
    \citealt{Hopkins2008, Dekel2009}) and then assemble their extended stellar 
    haloes via dry mergers 
    \citep[e.g,][]{Naab2006, Khochfar2006, Oser2010, Oser2012}, which allows for 
    significant growth at late times. 
    Meanwhile, progenitor bias, which proposes that larger ETGs were quenched more 
    recently, could also contribute to the apparent size growth, although its 
    important is under argument (e.g. \citealt{Newman2012, Carollo2013, 
    Poggianti2013, Belli2015, Keating2015, Fagioli2016}). 
    
    Several previous works have tested the two-phase formation scenario 
    observationally using galaxies at low redshift, looking at their surface 
    brightness of mass density profiles (e.g. \citealt{Huang2013a, Huang2013b, 
    Oh2017}, optical color gradients (e.g. \citealt{LaBarbera2010, LaBarbera2012}), 
    and stellar population gradients \citep[e.g.,][]{Coccato2010, Coccato2011, 
    Greene2015, Barbosa2016}. 
    These observations are generally consistent with the two-phase scenario, 
    but this picture still face many challenges.
    One of the most outstanding issues is the extent to which, at fixed stellar mass, 
    the accreted fraction depends on the surrounding dark matter halo mass. 
    
    According to this two-phase formation scenario, the late time growth of massive 
    ETGs is intrinsically tied to the growth of their host dark matter haloes 
    (e.g. \citealt{Leauthaud2012, Behroozi2013, Shankar2013}). 
    Massive ETGs that live at the center of more massive haloes should experience 
    different assembly and should be subject to higher merger rate compared to 
    ETGs with similar \mstar{} that live in less massive dark matter haloes. 
    A natural prediction of this picture is therefore that the structures of 
    massive ETGs should depend on their ``environment''\footnote{There are 
    different definitions of ``environment'' in the literature.  
    In this work, we use ``environment'' and halo mass interchangeably.}.
    For instance, models based on two-phase scenario predict that the well-know 
    stellar mass--effective radius relation for ETGs (\mstar{}--$R_{\rm e}$ relation; 
    e.g., \citealt{Shen2003, Guo2009}) should show environmental dependence: the 
    $R_{\rm e}$ of massive ETGs in more massive haloes should be larger than those 
    in less massive haloes at fixed \mstar{} 
    (e.g. \citealt{Shankar2013, Shankar2014}).
    Yet, solid evidence of this effect at low redshift is still missing 
    (e.g. \citealt{Nair2010, HCompany13}; but also see \citealt{Yoon2017}).
    
    %However, while hints of an environmental dependence in the mass-size relation have 
    %been spotted at high-$z$ (e.g. \citealt{Papovich2012, Lani2013, Delaye2014}; but 
    %also see \citealt{Rettura2010}). 
    
	% Song: Actually the Illustris paper suggests that, for massive galaxies, 
	%       even the inner region is dominated by accreted stars. 
	
    To seriously test the environmental dependence of structure in massive ETGs 
    requires highly sensitive observations extending beyond the inner region of these 
    galaxies to truly probe the material accreted at late times. 
    This is very challenging observation as the surface brightness drops rapidly 
    with radius in massive ETGs. 
    
    In \citet[][Paper I hereafter]{hscMassiveI}, we showed that the deep, 
    multi-band images from the Subaru Strategic Program (SSP; \citealt{HSC-SSP,
    HSC-DR1}) using Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC; \citealt{Miyazaki2012}, 
    Miyazaki in~prep.) allows us to extract robust surface stellar
    mass density (\mden{}) profiles for {\it individual} massive galaxies 
    at $0.3 < z < 0.5$ out to 100 kpc. 
    In Paper I, we exploited this sensitivity to show that the \mden{} profiles 
    and the shapes of the stellar haloes of massive ETGs has a clear \mstar{} 
    dependence. 
    And the fraction of accreted stars residing in the extended envelope increases
    with the total \mstar{} of the galaxy.
    
    In this paper, we explore how the extended stellar halo in massive central galaxies
    depends on dark matter halo mass with the help of HSC images of a large sample 
    of massive ETGs and the \redm{} cluster catalog (e.g.\ \citealt{Rykoff2014}; 
    \citealt{Rozo2015b}; please see \S \ref{sec:data} for details)
    
    This paper is organized as follows. 
    \S \ref{sec:data} briefly introduce the sample selection and data reduction 
    processes.  
    Please refer to \citet{hscMassiveI} for more technical details.
    Our main results are presented in \S \ref{sec:result} and discussed in 
    \S \ref{sec:discussion}. 
    \S \ref{sec:summary} presents our summary and conclusions.

    Magnitudes use the AB system (\citealt{Oke1983}), and are corrected for Galactic 
    extinction using calibrations from \citet{Schlafly11}.
    In this work, we assume $H_0$ = 70~km~s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, ${\Omega}_{\rm m}=0.3$, 
    and ${\Omega}_{\rm \Lambda}=0.7$.
    Stellar mass is denoted \mstar{} and has been derived using a Chabrier Initial Mass 
    Function (IMF; \citealt{Chabrier2003}).   
      
    Halo mass is defined as $M_{\rm 200b}$ as 
    $M_{\rm 200b}\equiv M(<r_{\rm 200b})=200\bar{\rho} 
    \frac{4}{3}\pi r_{\rm 200b}^3$ where $r_{\rm 200b}$
    is the radius at which the mean interior density is equal to 200 times
    the mean matter density ($\bar{\rho}$). 
    
    As in \citet{hscMassiveI}, we do not try to separate any potential ``intra-cluster''
    component (ICL; e.g. \citealt{Carlberg1997, Lin2004, Gonzalez2005, Mihos2005}) from 
    massive galaxies in our sample for both technical and scientific reasons.

\section{Sample Selection and Data Reduction}
    \label{sec:data}
    
    The sample selection and data reduction processes are described in detail in 
    Paper I. 
    Here we include a short summary for completeness.
    
    This work makes use of the imaging data from the internal data release 
    \texttt{S15B}, which is very similar to the Public Data Release 1 
    (\citealt{HSC-DR1} and covers ${\sim} 110$ deg$^2$ in all five-band ($grizy$) to 
    the required depth. 
    These images are reduced by \texttt{hscPipe 4.0.2}, a derivative of the 
    Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) pipeline (e.g.\ \citealt{Juric2015}; 
    \citealt{Axelrod2010}), modified for HSC (\citealt{HSC-PIPE}).
    The pixel scale of the reduced image is $0.168$\asec{}.
    We use the $i$-band image for extracting surface brightness profiles.    
    The HSC $i$-band image is typically 3--4 mag deeper than the SDSS one in surface 
    brightness limit and has superb seeing condition (mean FWHM$=0.6$\asec{}).
    
    In Paper~I, we select large sample of massive galaxies with either spectroscopic 
    redshift or reliable ``red-sequence'' photometric redshift (\citealt{Rykoff2014}) 
    at $0.3<z<0.5$. 
    Within this redshift range, we have large enough volume to achieve reasonable 
    statistics at very high \mstar{} end, can spatially resolve the inner $\sim 5$ 
    kpc of massive galaxies ($1.0^{\arcsec}$ corresponds to 4.4 and 6.1 kpc at 
    $z=0.3$ and 0.5), and can safely ignore any structural evolution. 
    We derive $i$-band surface brightness profiles out to 100 kpc after carefully 
    masking out any surrounding contaminations and correcting the background 
    subtraction. 
    We use the broadband spectral energy distributions (SED) fitting code 
    \texttt{iSEDFit}\footnote{http://www.sos.siena.edu/~jmoustakas/isedfit/} 
    (\citealt{Moustakas13}) to measure the average \m2l{} and $k$--correction of 
    these galaxies using five-band forced \cmodel{} magnitudes from \texttt{hscPipe}.

    \citet{Calzetti2000} extinction law, simple delayed-$\tau$ model for star 
    formation history (SFH) are assumed here. 
    Using these information, we obtain reliable \mden{} profiles of these 
    galaxies out to $> 100$ kpc and \mstar{} integrated to different physical 
    radius using elliptical apertures. 
    
    As explained in Paper I, here we focus on \mstar{} within
        
    \begin{itemize}
    
        \item a 10 kpc radii (hereafter noted \minn{}) as proxy of the 
            \textit{in situ} stellar component. 
            This is motivated by recent observations and simulations 
            (e.g.~\citealt{vanDokkum2010}, \citealt{RodriguezGomez2016}).  
            
        \item a 100 kpc radii (hereafter noted \mtot{}), which is shown to recover 
            more \mstar{} than the ones based on \cmodel{} photometry, as proxy of the 
            total \mstar{} of the galaxy.
            
   \end{itemize}
   
   Although these radius are empirically selected, they help recover the 
   \mstar{}-dependence of the fraction of accreted stars, and reveal the diversity of 
   stellar envelopes among massive galaxies. 
   In Figure \ref{fig:m100_m10_color}, we demonstrate such diversity by showing 
   a random subsample of massive galaxies with very similar \minn{} that have large 
   range of \mtot{}. 
   We will use these two apertures\mstar{} to guide the comparisons of massive galaxies 
   from different environments.

\subsection{Massive Central Galaxies from Different Environments}
    \label{ssec:cen}
         
    In this work, we focus on massive galaxies with \mtot{} $>10^{11.6}$~\msun{}. 
    In Paper~I, we demonstrate that the \mstar{} completeness above this threshold is 
    good over the full redshift range using comparisons with stellar mass functions 
    from more complete samples.
    
    We also wish to focus on massive galaxies that live at the centers of their own 
    dark matter haloes-- so-called ``central'' galaxies.  
    They are uniquely important to the study of galaxy-halo connection and are known 
    to follow stellar mass--halo mass relation (SHMR; e.g. \citealt{Leauthaud2012, 
    Behroozi2013, Kravtsov2014, Tinker2017}) at high-\mstar{} end with small scatter.
    We utilize the \redm{} \texttt{v5.10} \citep{Rykoff2014, Rozo2015b} cluster catalog 
    to identify central galaxies. 
    
    Firstly, we select 68 massive central galaxies from the \redm{} clusters 
    with $\lambda \geq 30$, $P_{\mathrm{Cen}} \geq 0.7$, and \logmtot{}$>11.5$ 
    at $0.3 < z < 0.5$ (63/69 have \logmtot{}$>11.6$). 
    This $\lambda$ limit is chosen to mitigate incompleteness of low richness clusters
    at the high end of our redshift window, and the $P_{\mathrm{Cen}}$ limit is 
    selected to exclude low probability candidate of central galaxy. 
    Based on the \mhalo{}-$\lambda$ relation calibrated by \citet{Simet2016}, these 
    galaxies are the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) of clusters with 
    \mhalo{}$>10^{14.2}$~\msun{}.
    This calibration is consistent with other works (e.g. \citealt{Saro2015, Farahi2016, 
    Melchior2016, Murata2017}). 
    The median richness of the sample is $\lambda \approx 41$ 
    (\mhalo{}$\approx 2.2 \times 10^{14}$~\msun{}), and there are 
    only 44 central galaxies in clusters with $\lambda>50$ 
    (\mhalo{}$\approx 3.0 \times 10^{14}$~\msun{}).
    We will refer to this sample of \textbf{central galaxies in more massive haloes} as 
    the \rbcg{} sample.
    
    Secondly, we build a complementary sample of central galaxies in lower-mass haloes
    by excluding all galaxies that are in any \redm{} cluster with $\lambda > 20$.
    We convert their $\lambda$ into $M_{\mathrm{200b}}$ using calibration by 
    \citet{Simet2016}. 
    Then we estimate the $R_{\mathrm{200b}}$ of each cluster using the method in 
    \citet{Diemer2015}. 
    And we exclude all galaxies within a cylinder around each cluster, with the radius
    equal to $R_{\mathrm{200b}}$ and length equal to twice the value of the photometric 
    redshift uncertainty (typically around 0.015 to 0.025). 
    We generally consider this sample as the central galaxies living in haloes with
    $M_{\mathrm{200b}} < 10^{14}$~\msun{}, and will refer to this sample as \nbcg{}.
    Initially, we select 3453 galaxies this way with \logmtot{}$> 11.2$ at 
    $0.3 < z < 0.5$. 
    Among them, 1564 (833) have \logmtot{}$> 11.5$ (11.6). 
    Satellite contamination should be relative low at the high-\mtot{} end
    (e.g. \citealt{Reid2014, Hoshino2015, Saito2016, vanUitert2016}). 
    For instance, the model from \citet{Saito2016} predicts a $\sim 7$\% 
    contamination in the \logmtot{}$>11.6$ sample from satellites from 
    \logmh$<11.4$ haloes.
    
    In Appendix~\ref{app:basic}, we show the distributions of redshift, \mtot{}, and 
    \minn{} for \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} samples. 
    We also compare these two samples on the \mtot{} - rest-frame $g-r$ color plane. 
    Both of them follow the same ``red-sequence'' without much contamination from the 
    ``blue clouds''. 
    
    It is worth noting that we failed to extract 1-D profiles for $\sim10$\% of 
    \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies due to physical (e.g. on-going major merger) or 
    nuisance (e.g.\ nearby foreground galaxy or bright star) reasons. 
    These situations happen more frequently for lower-\mtot{} galaxies, and should not 
    affect the results of this work.

\section{Results}
    \label{sec:result}
    
    As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:m100_m10_color}, massive central galaxies show 
    intriguing diversity on the \mtot{}-\minn{} plane and in their \mden{} profiles 
    in the outer haloes.  
    In Paper~1, we explore the \mstar{}-dependence of the stellar haloes in massive 
    galaxies, and conclude that the general trends are consistent with the 
    predictions of two-phase formation scenario. 
    In the following sections, we will investigate the relation between their 
    present day halo mass and their stellar haloes using the \mden{} profiles and 
    scaling relations for massive central galaxies with different $M_{\mathrm{200b}}$ 
    (\rbcg{} and \nbcg{}).
    
    We should emphasize again that although a circular aperture is shown on 
    Fig~\ref{fig:m100_m10_color}, we extract 1-D \mden{} profiles, estimate 
    \mtot{} and \minn{} using elliptical apertures defined by fluxed-weighted average 
    isophotal shape. 
    And, given the narrow \mstar{} and redshift range, we ignore \mstar{} growth 
    and structural evolution here
    (no star formation, lower merger rate \etal~e.g.\ \citealt{Bellstedt2016},
    \citealt{Inagaki2015}; but also see \citealt{Bai2014}). 

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\subsection{Environmental Dependence of the Profiles of Massive Galaxies}
    \label{ssec:sbp_mtot} 
       
    First, we ask whether the \mden{} profiles of massive central galaxies show 
    \mhalo{}-dependence within 100 kpc at fixed \mstar{}. 
    To perform meaning comparison, we build matched samples drawing from \rbcg{} and 
    \nbcg{} that are carefully matched in \mstar{} and redshift using KDTree algorithm 
    (please see Appendix~\ref{app:match} and Fig~\ref{fig:match} for details). 
    The similar distributions of redshift of the matched samples ensure that the 
    median \mden{} profiles from both samples are affected by seeing and background 
    subtraction to the same extend. 
    We address this issue more in Appendix~\ref{app:redshift}. 
    
    We match the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} samples using both \mtot{} and \minn{} in this
    work. 
    As explained in Paper~1, we use \mtot{} as proxy of the ``total'' \mstar{}
    of massive galaxies while treat \minn{} as a rough indicator of the mass of the 
    \textit{in situ} component. 
    
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%     
    Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1} compares the \mden{} profiles of massive central galaxies 
    in \rbcg{} (orange-red color) and \nbcg{} (grey-black color) at fixed \mtot{} 
    (left panel) and at fixed \minn{} (right panel). 
    The top panels show the individual \mden{} profiles along with the median profiles 
    for both samples. 
    The bottom panel of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1} shows the difference between the median 
    \mden{} profile of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} samples, with errors computed via bootstrap 
    resampling.
    $\Delta = \log(\mu_{\star, \mathrm{cenHighMh}}) - 
    \log(\mu_{\star, \mathrm{cenLowMh}})$. 
    This figure presents the main results of this work: \textbf{The \mden{} profiles of 
    massive central galaxies show \mhalo{}-dependence at both fixed \mtot{} and 
    \minn{}.}
    For both \mtot{}-- and \minn{}--matched samples, we see systematic differences
    between the median \mden{} profile of \rbcg{} galaxies and the one for \nbcg{}
    galaxies. 

    We perform statistical tests to show that the differences we see in the median 
    \mden{} profiles are significant. 
    We also conduct a variety of tests that verify the robustness of these results 
    against choices of \mtot{} bins, $\lambda$ cut, redshift range, and the proxy
    of ``total'' or \textit{in situ} stellar mass. 
    Please see Appendix~\ref{app:robust} for more details about these tests.
   
    There are several important points to be noticed on the left panel of 
    Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}. 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        
        \item First, for the \mtot{} matched sample, although the difference in 
            median \mden{} profiles is systematical and robust, the overall difference 
            is very subtle and only becomes clear in the outskirts at $R>50$ kpc, 
            which explains why such environment dependence is extremely difficult 
            for previous works to detect using shallower images.
            
        \item Second, we find that, at fixed \mtot{}, massive central galaxies in 
            more massive dark mater haloes display shallower \mden{} profiles that the 
            ones living in less massive haloes. 
            This can be seen from the more flattened inner \mden{} profile and more 
            significant outer stellar haloes.
        
        \item Third, the median \mden{} profiles of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} cross each 
            other at ${\sim} 15$-20 kpc, the expected $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ for massive 
            ETGs around this \mtot{}. 
        
        \item Finally, such systematic difference in \mden{} profiles may become more 
            significant at higher \mtot{}.
            We see evidence of this using the $Delta$ profiles of two \mtot{} 
            bins (see Fig~\ref{fig:prof_2} and discussion in 
            Appendix~\ref{app:robust})\footnote{Though the lower \mtot{} bin becomes 
            somewhat incomplete} and when we discuss the relation between \mtot{} and 
            \minn{} (see Fig~\ref{fig:scaling_relation}). 
            This trend has potentially interesting implication that is worth more 
            investigations later.  
            
    \end{itemize}

    Generally speaking, such subtle environmental dependence of \mden{} profiles in 
    the \mtot{}-matched samples suggests that environment does not play a major role 
    in shaping massive galaxies \textbf{at fixed ``total'' stellar mass}.
    Therefore it is interesting to ask, for massive galaxies that \textbf{contain 
    similar \mstar{} in the \textit{in situ} component}, how does environment affect 
    their subsequent mass assembly?
    Assuming \minn{} is reasonable tracer of the \textit{in situ} mass, we compare the 
    \mden{} profiles of \minn{}-matched samples (right panel of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}).  
    Although the median \mden{} profiles are very similar at $R \leq 10$ kpc, the
    massive central galaxies in more massive haloes host much more prominent outer 
    stellar halo. 
    
    Meanwhile, the uniform slope of the \mden{} profile within 10 kpc is in sharp 
    contrast with the large \textit{intrinsic} scatter in the outskirts. 
    It hints that these two regions are shaped by distinctive processes, and may 
    explain why they depend on environment at different levels.  
    In simulations, intensive dissipative process helps create 
    self-similar de~Vaucouleur-like ($n{\sim} 4$) \mden{} profile in the inner part 
    of massive galaxy (e.g. \citealt{Hopkins2008}), and the \mhalo{}-dependent
    merging history leads to shallower stellar halo profile for central galaxy 
    of more massive halo (e.g. \citealt{Pillepich2014}). 
    The scatter of halo assembly process at fixed halo mass and the stochastic 
    nature of the galaxy--galaxy mergers also explain the large \textit{intrinsic} 
    scatter in the outer \mden{} profiles and the diversity seen on the 
    \mtot{}--\minn{} plane (Fig~\ref{fig:m100_m10_color}).

    \textbf{In summary, we reliably detect subtle, but systematic \mhalo{}-dependence 
    (environmental dependence) of \mden{} profiles within 100 kpc in massive central 
    galaxies}. 
    Such dependence seems to be consistent with the expectation of more (minor) 
    mergers in more massive dark matter haloes. 
    Non-dissipative (minor) mergers should not strongly alter the inner \mden{} 
    profiles, but can build up the outer halo efficiently
    (e.g. \citealt{Hilz2013}, \citealt{Oogi2013}).

\subsection{The Environmental Dependence of Scaling Relations}
    \label{ssec:scaling}
    
    Although the comparisons of \mden{} profiles can reveal the environment dependence 
    directly, it is not straightforward to compare with other observations, model 
    predictions or numerical simulations. 
    In this section, we compare the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies on 
    1) the well-know \mstar{}--$R_{\mathrm{e}}$ relation; 
    2) the \mtot{}--\minn{} plane. 
    
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\subsubsection{Mass-Size Relation}
    \label{sssec:mass_size}
    
    The tight relation between \mstar{} and effective radius (or half-light radius; 
    $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ or $R_{\mathrm{50}}$; e.g. \citealt{Shankar2013, Leja2013, 
    vdWel2014}) is one of the most important scaling relation for ETGs. 
    Despite numerous attempts, previous works failed to demonstrate the impact of 
    environment to the \mstar{}--$R_{\mathrm{e}}$ relation at low-$z$ 
    (e.g. \citealt{Weinmann2009, Nair2010, HCompany13, Cerbrian2014}; 
    but see \citealt{Yoon2017}). 
    
    In the last section, we show that the median \mden{} profiles of massive central 
    galaxies depend on environment. 
    We therefore expect to also see difference in the \mstar{}--$R_{\mathrm{e}}$ 
    relations of the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} samples. 
    For this purpose, we still use \mtot{} as proxy of ``total'' \mstar{}, and adopt 
    the radius enclosing 50\% of luminosity within 100 kpc ($R_{\mathrm{50}}$; derived 
    from the $i$-band curve-of-growth) as ``size''. 
    This definition of ``effective radius'' is more robust against structural details, 
    choice of model, and the background subtraction. 
    Massive galaxies from this sample are large enough so we do not need to worry 
    about the effects of seeing.
    
    Left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:scaling_relation} shows the \mtot{}--$R_{\mathrm{50}}$
    relations for both \rbcg{} (orange--red color) and \nbcg{} (grey--black color). 
    We fit the \logmtot{}-$\log (R_{\mathrm{50}}/\mathrm{kpc})$ relations at 
    \logmtot{}$\geq 11.6$ using MCMC method with the help from ensemble sampler 
    \texttt{emcee} (\citealt{Emcee})\footnote{The initial guesses are based on maximum 
    likelihood estimates, and we assume reasonable flat priors for parameters.}.
    The best-fit relation for \rbcg{} is:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log (R_{\mathrm{50}}/\mathrm{kpc}) = & (0.73\pm0.13) \times \log (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & -(7.49\pm1.56)
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent And for \nbcg{}, we find:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log (R_{\mathrm{50}}/\mathrm{kpc}) = & (0.68\pm0.06) \times \log (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & -(6.88\pm0.75)
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    
    \noindent As shown in the left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:scaling_relation}, the slopes 
    of the \mtot{}--$R_{\mathrm{50}}$ relations are similar, but their normalizations 
    show difference between the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies. 
    This result is robust against the ranges of \mstar{}, also against the definitions 
    of  ``total'' \mstar{} and half-light radius\footnote{Using \mstar{} within 120 or 
    150 kpc, or using the $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ derived within these apertures will not 
    change the results.}.
    
    We qualitatively compare our results with \citealt{HCompany13} (HC13; 
    green solid line) who studied $z\leq 0.09$ central ETGs in 
    $12.5 \le$ \logmh{} $< 15$ haloes. 
    HC13 uses the group catalog by \citet{Yang2007} to estimate \mhalo{}. 
    They estimate the 2-D $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ using single-\ser{} model fitting to SDSS 
    images, and derived \mstar{} based on SED fitting using the BC03 (\citealt{BC03}) 
    synthetic population model. 
    The \mstar{} estimates are empirically converted from a Kroupa IMF to a Chabrier 
    IMF by applying a constant -0.05 shift (see \citealt{Bernardi2016}).
    We add $+0.1$dex to the HSC13 \mstar{} to account for the systematic 
    difference between their BC03 and our FSPS model (see Appendix~\ref{app:sed}). 
    The distributions of both \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies on the 
    \mtot{}--$R_{\mathrm{50}}$ plane follow the HC13 relation reasonably well 
    (with slightly shallower slopes), even at \logmtot{}$< 11.6$ where our samples 
    start to become incomplete. 
    In contrast to the present study, HC13 finds no environment dependence in the 
    mass--size relation for central galaxies from $12.5\le$ \logmh{} $<15.0$ haloes.
    The \mstar{} and $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ in HC13 are based on much shallower SDSS images
    that can not constrain the environment-sensitive outer stellar haloes well. 
    Detailed analysis on this topic is beyond the scope of this work, but we briefly 
    demonstrate this using the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies that overlap with the GAMA
    survey (please see Appendix~\ref{app:gama} for details). 
    We matched the two samples using the \mstar{} measured using single-\ser{} 2-D
    model by the GAMA team (\citealt{Kelvin2012}). 
    At fixed \mgama{}, the \rbcg{} galaxies display much more significant stellar 
    halo despite they have very similar inner \mden{} profiles.  
    This shows again that the deeper HSC images has unique advantage in studying the
    connection between the assembly of massive galaxies and their dark matter haloes. 

    In conclusion, we confirm that the \mtot{}--$R_{\mathrm{50}}$ relation of massive
    central galaxies at $0.3 < z < 0.5$ depends on halo mass. 
    At fixed \mtot{}, massive central galaxies in denser environment (higher \mhalo{}) 
    have slightly larger $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ comparing to ones in smaller haloes at fixed 
    \mtot{}.

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\subsubsection{\mtot{} - \minn{} Relation}
    \label{sssec:m100_m10}
    
    Now we investigate the relationship between \mstar{} within two elliptical 
    apertures (\mtot{} v.s. \minn{}) as alternative tool to help us explore the 
    structure and assembly of massive galaxies.
    Comparing to the mass--size relation, this relation is not affected by the 
    ambiguous definition of ``size'', and it is easier to apply it to larger 
    samples or numerical simulations. 
    
    The right panel of Fig \ref{fig:scaling_relation} compares the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{}
    galaxies on the \mtot{}--\minn{} plane.
    We show that these two samples occupy slightly different locations on this plane,
    and follow different best--fit \mtot{}--\minn{} relations. 
    For \rbcg{} galaxies with \logmtot{}$>11.6$ we find:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log (M_{\star, 10\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) = & (0.48\pm0.06) \times \log (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & +(5.72\pm0.75).
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    
    \noindent In the same range of \mtot{}, the best-fit relation for \nbcg{} is:
     
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log (M_{\star, 10\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) = & (0.56\pm0.03) \times \log (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & +(4.82\pm0.30).
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    
    These results are robust against the \mtot{} range for fitting, and they will not 
    be affected if we replace the \minn{} with \mstar{} within 5 or 15 kpc apertures
    or replace the \mtot{} with \mstar{} within 120 or 150 kpc apertures.  
    The \mtot{}--$M_{\star, 5\ \mathrm{kpc}}$ relation actually suggests clearer 
    \mhalo{}-dependence at high-\mtot{} end, but the $M_{\star, 5\ \mathrm{kpc}}$ 
    are more vulnerable to the impact from seeing than \minn{}.
     
    We conclude that: 
    (1) At fixed \mtot{}, central galaxies in more massive haloes tend to have 
    lower fractions of \mstar{} stored in the inner region; 
    (2) For massive galaxies with similar \minn{}, the ones in more massive haloes on 
    average have more prominent outer envelopes. 
    The scientific implication of this result is briefly discussed in 
    Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

    Meanwhile, we find \rbcg{} galaxy tends to have lower \mstar{} within 10--15 kpc 
    and shallower inner \mden{} profile than the \nbcg{} one at fixed \mtot{}. 
    Although the HSC can not resolve the central region of these massive galaxies, 
    such difference could have interesting physical implications. 
    Observations of compact quiescent galaxies at high-$z$ tend to suggest higher 
    \mden{} in the central region than their descendants, hence it is necessary to 
    have certain process to reduce the central \mden{} (e.g. strong adiabatic expansion 
    induced by powerful AGN feedback; \citealt{Fan2008}) to match the inner \mden{} 
    profiles of massive central galaxies at low-$z$.
    Coalesce of super-massive black hoes (SMBHs) at the end of major merger, which is 
    common in the assembly history of massive galaxies, can also flatten the central 
    \mden{} profile via efficient scattering effect (e.g. \citealt{Milosavljevi2002}).
    On the right side of Fig \ref{fig:scaling_relation}, we find a few \rbcg{} galaxies 
    with very low \minn{} at high \mtot{} end that are apparently not bothered by 
    problematic photometry or exceptionally bad seeing.  
    They may be similar to the recently discovered massive BCGs with very large core 
    (a few kpc; e.g. \citealt{Postman2012, LopezCruz2014}) resulting from SMBH mergers.
    The impacts of these processes, and their dependence on \mhalo{} is an interesting 
    topic to investigate in the future.

\subsection{Ellipticity and Color Profiles}
    \label{ssec:ell_color}
    
    In Paper~1, we show that the ellipticity of outer stellar halo in massive galaxy 
    steadily increases with \mtot{}, while the rest--frame color gradients do not show 
    clear \mtot{}-dependence. 
    Both these results provide us more insights about the assembly of massive galaxies. 
    Here we quickly look into the environment dependence of ellipticity and 
    rest--frame color profiles (Figure~\ref{fig:ell_color}). 
    
    We focus on ellipticity and color profiles within 5--60 kpc where we can safely 
    ignore differences in sky subtraction and seeing across different bands. 
    We apply Galactic extinction and $k$-correction to both $(g-r)$ and $(g-i)$ color 
    profiles.
    We show the average ellipticity, $g-r$, and $g-i$ color profiles for the 
    \mtot{}-matched (\minn{}-matched) samples of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies on the 
    left (right) side of \ref{fig:ell_color} along with comparisons with previous 
    works based on stacked SDSS galaxies 
    (e.g. \citealt{LaBarbera2010, Tal2011, DSouza2014}).
    
    These results show: 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        
        \item Once matched at fixed \mtot{}, the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies 
            show similar average ellipticity profiles. 
            There is hint that suggests the central galaxies from more massive 
            haloes become slightly more elongated at $R>50$ kpc than the ones 
            in less massive haloes with similar \mtot{}. 
            However, the uncertainties in the current profiles make it not 
            conclusive. 
            
        \item For the \minn{}-matched samples, the \rbcg{} galaxies show higher
            average ellipticity than the \nbcg{} ones at $R > 10$ kpc. 
            The average ellipticities in the inner region are very similar. 
            This further suggests that the more elongated outer stellar haloes 
            of massive haloes relate to the accreted stars. 
            
        \item For the rest--frame color gradients, we find shallow and negative 
            gradients for both \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies using both colors.
            We find no significant difference for both the \mtot{}- and 
            \minn{}--matched samples within 60 kpc. 
    
    \end{itemize}
    
    Besides these conclusions, these comparisons also suggest: 
    
    \begin{itemize}
    
        \item The smooth ellipticity profile and its shallow gradient supports 
            the idea of using the flux-weighted average isophotal shape to 
            extract 1-D profiles of massive galaxies. 
            
        \item The similarity of average rest-frame color profiles between the 
            \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} samples suggests that \mden{} profiles based on 
            single average \m2l{} will not bias our comparisons. 
    
    \end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
    \label{sec:discussion}
    
    Using the deep images from the HSC survey, we show that the stellar mass 
    distributions of massive central galaxies at $0.3 < z < 0.5$ depend on their 
    environment or \mhalo{}. 
    Here we briefly discuss the physical implications and potential caveats of this 
    result. 
    
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\subsection{The Role of Environment in the ``Two--Phase'' Formation of 
            Massive Central Galaxies}
            
    Results presented here are broadly consistent with the picture that massive central 
    galaxies form via a ``two-phase'' picture. 
    
    
    According to this theory, the cores of massive galaxies were formed at $z{\sim} 2$ 
    during an intense period of \textit{in situ} star formation. 
    The outskirts of massive galaxies are then built up via a more gradual second 
    phase of evolution (the ``ex-situ'' phase) which is dominated by mass growth via 
    the accretion of satellite systems. 
    Non-dissipative minor mergers mostly deposit stars on the outskirts of the 
    centrals and do not have large impact on the central \mden{} profile 
    (e.g. \citealt{Oogi2013, Bedorf2013}). 
    Hence, according to this picture, the outer stellar envelopes of massive centrals 
    should correlate with the masses of their host haloes, in qualitative agreement with
    our findings. 
          
    State of the art hydrodynamic simulations suggest that massive dark matter haloes 
    have central galaxies that have outer stellar envelopes with shallow slopes 
    (e.g. \citealt{Pillepich2014}). 
    This is consistent with the results in Fig \ref{fig:prof_1}.
     
    Meanwhile, these simulation also point out that the fraction of accreted stars 
    increases steeply with total \mstar{} and that the ``ex-situ'' component
    starts to dominate the \mden{} profiles around $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ for 
    \logms{}$\geq 11.5$ galaxies. 
    In this work, we find that the median \mden{} profiles of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} 
    samples start to show differences around 15-20 kpc, which is close to 
    their $R_{\mathrm{e}}$. 
    Furthermore, the environmental dependence of our median \mden{} profiles 
    becomes more significant in our highest \mtot{} bin (see Fig \ref{fig:prof_4}). 
    These results all align with the picture that the \mhalo{}-dependence of the 
    \mden{} profiles of massive galaxies is driven by the variations in the 
    ``ex-situ'' component at large radii.

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\subsection{Scatter in Outer Stellar Enveloppes and ``cD'' Galaxies}
        
   The thin lines in Figure \ref{fig:prof_1} show the \mden{} density profiles of 
   individual galaxies. 
   In general, we find that any given galaxy has a relatively smooth profile, even out 
   to large radii, however, on a galax-by-galaxy basis there is a large (but continuous) 
   variation in the amplitude of \mden{} at large scales. 
   Traditionally, the so-called ``cD'' galaxies are defined to have large stellar 
   envelopes and are found at the hearts of massive clusters (\citealt{Matthews1964, 
   Schombert1988}). 
   However, until present, it has not been clear whether ``cD'' galaxies are a distinct 
   and special population, or if they are simply the conti of a smoothly varying 
   population. 
   Fig \ref{fig:prof_1} shows that with the help of our deep HSC images, we can directly 
   map out the variations in \mden{} profiles at large scales. 
   Instead of a bi-model distribution, we find that the outskirts of massive galaxies 
   display a smooth but continuous variation. 
   We can hence conclude that ``cD'' galaxies are simply the extremes of a continuous 
   population but that do not necessarily form a unique a special class of galaxies. 
   This suggests that it might not be very physically meaningful to separate these 
   massive galaxies into two arbitrary morphological classes (``cD'' versus non-``cD''). 
   This conclusion is similar to those of \citep{Zhao2015} who found that a large 
   fraction of nearby BCGs (34\%) does not fall into the ``cD'' class. 
   Our finding that massive galaxies display a diverse range of outer stellar 
   envelope is also supported by HST observations of BCGs at $0.3 < z <0.9$ 
   by \citealt{Bai2014}.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}
    \label{sec:summary}
    
    Using the high-quality images from the first $\sim100$ deg$^2$ data of the 
    Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program, we group a large sample of massive 
    central galaxies at $0.3 < z < 0.5$ into two categories based on their dark matter
    halo mass (\mhalo{}$\simgt 10^{14.2} M_{\odot}$ and 
    \mhalo{}$\simlt 10^{14} M_{\odot}$), and study how their stellar mass distributions 
    out to 100 kpc depend on their environments (or \mhalo{}). 
    The main results are:  
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    
        \item At fixed \mtot{}, we find that massive central galaxies display \mden{} 
            profiles that have large intrinsic scatter in the outer stellar haloes and 
            present subtle but systematic trend with \mhalo{}.
            On average, massive central galaxies in more massive haloes have slightly 
            shallower inner \mden{} profiles and more prominent outer haloes. 
            This suggests that the environment affects the assembly of massive central
            galaxies at fixed ``total'' stellar mass.
            
        \item At fixed \minn{}, massive central galaxies in more massive haloes 
            possess much more extended stellar haloes than the ones in smaller haloes, 
            despite their median \mden{} profiles at $R < 15$ kpc are very similar. 
            Assuming that \minn{} traces the amount of ``in situ'' stars in massive
            galaxies, this results is consistent with the picture that more massive 
            haloes favor the growth of extended stellar haloes in their central 
            galaxies through more frequent mergers. 
        
        \item The \mtot{}-$R_{\mathrm{50}}$ relation for massive central galaxies 
            also exhibits environmental dependence. 
            Central galaxies in more massive haloes have slightly larger
            $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ than the ones from less massive haloes at fixed \mtot{}. 
        
        \item We also find that massive central galaxies in different environments
            follow different relations between their \mtot{} and \minn{}. 
            Assuming that \mtot{} is a reasonable proxy of ``total'' stellar mass and 
            \minn{} reflects the amount of \textit{in situ} stars, we propose that 
            this relation can help diagnose the assembly of massive central galaxies 
            without using ``size'' with ambiguous definition. 
        
        \item At fixed \mtot{}, the ellipticity profiles of massive central galaxies 
            do not display strong environment dependence at $R < 60$ kpc. 
            At fixed \minn{}, the more extended stellar haloes presented in the \rbcg{}
            galaxies also show higher ellipticity than the \nbcg{} galaxies. 
        
        \item We do not find evidence that suggests the rest-frame color profiles 
            within 60 kpc depend on environment for neither \mtot{}- nor 
            \minn{}--matched samples. 
             
    \end{enumerate}
    
    These results highlight the importance of deep, high-quality images for studying 
    the assembly of massive haloes and their central galaxies. 
    We are currently working on combining the current results with weak lensing 
    measurements of dark matter haloes around these massive galaxies to gain more physical 
    insights. 
    We will also compare our results with cosmological hydro-simulations 
    such as 
    \textit{Illustris-TNG} (\citealt{Pillepich2017a, Pillepich2017b, Weinberger2017}, 
    \textit{Horizon-AGN} (\citealt{Dubois2014}), or 
    \textit{MassiveBlackII} (\citealt{Khandai2015}).

\section{A. Basic Statistical Properties of the Sample} 
	\label{app:basic} 
    
    On the top-left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:sample_stats}, we show the \mtot{}-color 
    relations using the $k$-corrected $g-r$ color. 
    Both samples follow the same tight ``red-sequence'' with little contamination 
    from the ``blue cloud''.
    At fixed \mtot{}, we see little offset in color distributions of the two 
    samples, suggesting that both samples consist of quiescent galaxies with 
    similar average stellar population properties.  
    This is consistent with previous result that suggests the average stellar 
    population of massive central galaxy does not depend on \mhalo{} 
    (e.g.\ \citealt{Park2007}).  
    In this work, we focus on the \mstar{} range of $11.6 \le$\logmtot{}$\le 11.9$, 
    where both samples have acceptable completeness, and their \mtot{} distributions 
    greatly overlap (see the normalized distributions of \mtot{} in the bottom-left 
    panel of Fig~\ref{fig:sample_stats}). 
    As for the \minn{} distributions, the two samples overlap the most within 
    $11.2 \le$\logmtot{}$\le 11.6$, but now they show quite different
    distributions (bottom-right figure).
    
    The redshift distributions also show small difference
    (upper-right panel) even in the high-\mtot{} bin, where the redshift distribution 
    of the \nbcg{} sample skews toward higher-$z$ end due to the contribution of BOSS 
    spec-$z$.
    Since this could bias the comparison of \mden{} profiles and other properties 
    (please see Appendix\ref{app:redshift} for more details), we address this via matching 
    the two samples in both mass and redshift distributions carefully
    (see Appendix~\ref{app:match}).

\section{B. Comparisons of \mden{} profiles in different redshift bins}
    \label{app:redshift}

    Given the redshift range for our samples, it is important to evaluate 
    the impacts from the physical extend of seeing and the imaging depth on the \mden{} 
    profiles at different redshift. 
    Under the same seeing, the \mden{} profile of galaxy at higher-$z$ is more 
    vulnerable to the PSF smearing effect at the center. 
    It is also harder to reach to the same \mden{} level under the same imaging depth 
    due to cosmological dimming and background noise. 
    
    In Fig~\ref{fig:avg_prof_z}, we group the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies within 
    $11.6 \le$\logmtot$< 11.9$ into two $z$ bins ($0.3\leq z<0.4$ and $0.4\leq z<0.5$),
    and compare their \mden{} profiles. 
    In two redshift bins, the median \mden{} profiles from the same sample follow each 
    other very well outside 10 kpc, but become visibly different in the central 3-4 kpc,
    where the effect from seeing kicks in. 
    Meanwhile, the median \mden{} profiles of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} in the same $z$ bin 
    are identical in the central region, which indicates similar average seeing 
    conditions.       
    This confirms that \mden{} profile at $> 5$ kpc is safe from the impacts of seeing 
    and difference in redshift.
    More importantly, it also suggests that, once the redshift distributions are 
    carefully matched, the difference of \mden{} profile is likely to be physical 
    even in the central region.

\section{C. Match the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} samples in \mstar{} and redshift distributions}
    \label{app:match}

    As explained earlier, it is important to make sure the two samples have similar 
    distributions in both \mstar{} and redshift before comparing their median \mden{} 
    profiles.  
    Here we briefly describe the procedure used in this work. 
    Since the \rbcg{} sample is smaller in size, we always match the \nbcg{} sample to 
    it by searching for the $N$-nearest neighbours on the $M_{\star}$-redshift plane 
    using the KDTree algorithm in the \texttt{scikit-learn} Python library 
    (\citealt{scikit-learn}), and evaluate the quality of the match using the 
    distributions of both parameters (as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:match}). 
 
    As we only keep the unique \nbcg{} galaxies in the matched sample, we manually 
    adjust the value of $N$ to achieve the best match. 
    When the redshift distribution of the \rbcg{} sample becomes bi-model, we also try 
    to split the sample into two redshift bins and match them separately. 
    Typically $N$ is between 3 to 8.
    In Fig~\ref{fig:match}, we demonstrate this procedure using the results for 
    the \mtot{}-matched (Left) and the \minn{}-matched samples in Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}
    (Right), and the two samples are well matched in the distributions of \mtot{}
    (or \minn{}) and redshift.  
    For all the comparisons of \mden{} profiles in this work, we match the samples 
    in the same way, and make sure the match has the same quality.

\section{D. Robustness of the \mden{} Differences} 
	\label{app:robust}
    
    In Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}, we compare the \mden{} profiles of \mtot{}- and 
    \minn{}-matched samples of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies, and here we test the 
    robustness of the results using a few extra tests that are illustrated in
    Fig~\ref{fig:prof_2}, Fig~\ref{fig:prof_3}, and Fig~\ref{fig:prof_4}, and 
    are briefly described here:   
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        
        \item In Fig~\ref{fig:prof_2}, we group the samples into two \mtot{} bins. 
            Given the small sample size, we extend slightly toward lower \mtot{} range 
            ($11.5 \leq \log (M_{\star,\ 10\mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) < 11.7$ and 
             $11.7 \leq \log (M_{\star,\ 10\mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) < 11.9$). 
            Although the smaller sample leads to larger statistical uncertainties, 
            we can still see similar structural differences in both \mtot{} bins, 
            and the difference becomes more significant in the higher \mtot{} bin.  
            For the lower \mtot{} bin, the difference in the inner region becomes 
            quite uncertain, while the difference in the outskirt is still visible. 
            This potentially suggests that the environmental dependence of structure 
            also varies with \mstar{}, an important implication deserves more 
            investigations in the future.   

        \item On the left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_3}, we match the \rbcg{} and 
            \nbcg{} samples in a lower redshift bins ($0.30 < z < 0.42$).
            Despite the larger uncertainties due to smaller samples, we find the 
            results are the same.
            
        \item On the middle panel of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_3}, we includes \rbcg{} 
            galaxies in poorer clusters ($20 < \lambda < 30$), which should result 
            in overlapped \mhalo{} distributions with the \nbcg{} samples 
            considering the typical uncertainty of $\lambda$.
            This makes the difference in the inner region slightly less significant, 
            but the overall results are the same. 
             
        \item On the right panel of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_3}, in stead of using \mtot{}, 
            we use the \mmax{}--the maximum \mstar{} by integrating the \mden{} 
            profiles to the largest radius allowed.  
            The \mmax{} values are less reliable than \mtot{} due to the 
            uncertainty of background subtraction and contamination from nearby 
            bright objects, but they can serve as different estimates of the ``total''
            \mstar{} of these galaxies.
            As shown in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}, they on average increase
            the \mstar{} by a little bit and affect the \rbcg{} more.
            The differences in the \mden{} profiles still remain very similar.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
    We also test the robustness of the \mtot{}-matched results using the samples with 
    only spectroscopic redshift, the samples in the three GAMA fields, and the \rbcg{} 
    samples without the ones in very massive haloes ($\lambda > 40$).  
    Limited by space, we do not show these results here, but they all verify the 
    robustness of the results. 
    
    For the results from the \minn{}-matched samples: 
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    
        \item
            We match the two samples using both \minn{} and the \mstar{} within 15 kpc 
            at the same time.  
            This makes the two median \mden{} profiles very similar inside 10-15 
            kpc, while the result in the outskirt remains the same (left panel of 
            Fig~\ref{fig:prof_4}).
            Use \mstar{} within 5 or 20 kpc leads to the same conclusion. 
          
        \item 
            To make sure the two samples are comparable in their overall assembly history,
            we also try to only include the very massive galaxies (\logmtot{}$>11.5$)
            in both samples. 
            This excludes the \nbcg{} galaxies that are much less massive and 
            more ``compact'' in structure. 
            Yet, the results regarding the structural differences remain the same. 
          
    \end{enumerate}

\section{E. Comparison of \mden{} profiles using \mstar{} from the GAMA survey}
    \label{app:gama} 

    The GAMA survey greatly overlaps with the HSC survey, and it provides carefully 
    measured \mstar{} for large sample of galaxies (\citealt{Taylor2011}) that help 
    produce many interesting results (e.g. \citealt{Bauer2013, Ferreras2017}).
    They use 2-D single-\ser{} model to correct the total luminosity of the galaxy 
    (\citealt{Kelvin2012}), and derive the \m2l{} through optical-SED fitting 
    (BC03 model; Chabrier IMF) based on the PSF-matched aperture photometry. 
    Since the \ser{} model is generally more flexible than the \texttt{cModel} one, 
    it is therefore interesting to compare with the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies 
    that also have spec-$z$ (at $z < 0.40$) and \mstar{} in GAMA DR2 
    (\citealt{Liske2015}) and see the impact of deep photometry again. 
    
    We summarize the results in Fig~\ref{fig:gama}.  
    On the left panel, we compare the differences between \mtot{} and \mgama{}. 
    HSC survey on average recovers more \mstar{} at high-\mstar{} end, which is 
    consistent with the expectation from deeper photometry, although the 
    systematic differences in the estimates of \m2l{} could play a role here. 
    Meanwhile, it is interesting see that, above \logmtot{}$> 11.8$, \mgama{} 
    becomes increasingly larger than \mtot{}, and most of these massive 
    galaxies have very high \ser{} index from the 2-D fitting. 
    This suggests that the single-\ser{} model is no longer an appropriate one to 
    describe very massive galaxies as it tends to over-estimate the \mstar{} the 
    inner and/or outer regions. 
    
    To verify the cause of the difference in \mstar{}, we further select samples 
    of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies with matched \mgama{} and redshift 
    distributions (at $11.4 <$\logmgama{}$<11.8$; see Appendix \ref{app:match}), 
    and compare their \mden{} profiles (right panel). 
    Although these two subsamples are equally massive according to results from 
    GAMA survey, it is clear that the \rbcg{} galaxy has much more extended 
    outer envelope, even though its median \mden{} profile is very similar 
    to the \nbcg{} sample at $< 10$ kpc. 
    We can reproduce very the same trend with the luminosity density profiles 
    (with or without $k$-correction), suggesting that the inaccurate \ser{} 
    model definitely leads to under-estimate of \mstar{}.
