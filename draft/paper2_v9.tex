\begin{abstract}  We use ${\sim}100$ deg$^2$ of 
    deep ($>28.5$ \sb{} in $i$-band), high-quality 
    (median 0.6\asec seeing) imaging data from the Hyper Suprime--Cam (HSC) survey to reveal the halo mass dependence of the surface mass density profiles and outer stellar envelopes of massive galaxies. The $i$-band images from the HSC survey reach ${\sim}4$ magnitudes deeper than 
    Sloan Digital Sky Survey and enable us to directly trace stellar mass distributions 
    to 100 kpc without requiring stacking.  
    We conclusively show that, at fixed stellar mass, the stellar profiles of massive 
    galaxies depend on the masses of their dark matter haloes. 
    On average, massive central galaxies with \logmtot{}$>11.6$ in more massive haloes 
    at $0.3 < z < 0.5$ have shallower inner stellar mass density profiles 
    (within ${\sim}10$--$20$ kpc) and more prominent outer envelopes. 
    These differences translate into a halo mass dependence of the mass--size relation. Central galaxies in haloes with \logmh{}$>14.0$ are $\sim 20$\% larger in $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ at fixed \mtot{}. Such dependence is also reflected in the relationship between the stellar mass 
    within 10 and 100 kpc.  Comparing to the mass--size relation, the \mtot{}--\minn{} relation avoids the 
    ambiguity in the definition of size, and can be straightforwardly compared with 
    simulations. 
    Our results demonstrate that, with deep images from HSC, we can quantify the 
    connection between halo mass and the outer stellar halo, which may provide new 
    constraints on the formation and assembly of massive central galaxies.

\section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:intro}
    
    A key discovery in the last decade has been the dramatic structural transformation 
    of massive quiescent galaxies \citep[e.g.,][]{Trujillo2006, vanDokkum2008, 
    Cimatti2008, Damjanov2009, vanderWel2011, Szomoru2012, Patel2013} from 
    $z \approx 2$ to the present day. 
    These observations suggest that the progenitors of $z{\sim} 0$ massive early-type 
    galaxies (ETGs) need to increase their effective radii ($R_{\rm e}$) by a factor 
    of 2--4 over a time span of 10 Gyrs (e.g., \citealt{Newman2012, vdWel2014}). 
    This observational result spurred the development of the `two-phase' formation
    scenario for massive ETGs (e.g., \citealt{Oser2010, Oser2012}),
    in which galaxies form a compact central region at $z\sim 2$ through highly 
    dissipative processes (e.g., gas-rich mergers or cold gas-accretion;
    \citealt{Hopkins2008, Dekel2009}). 
    They subsequently assemble extended stellar haloes via dry mergers 
    \citep[e.g.,][]{Naab2006, Khochfar2006, Oser2010, Oser2012}, which can cause 
    significant size growth at late times. 
    An alternative explanation for size growth, progenitor bias, hypothesizes that 
    larger ETGs were quenched more recently; but this explanation is still under 
    active debate (e.g., \citealt{Newman2012, Carollo2013, Poggianti2013, Belli2015,
    Keating2015, Fagioli2016}). 
    
    There have been multiple observational attempts to test the two-phase 
    formation scenario using galaxies at low redshift, by investigating surface 
    brightness or mass density profiles (e.g., \citealt{Huang2013a, Huang2013b, 
    Oh2017}, optical colour gradients (e.g., \citealt{LaBarbera2010, LaBarbera2012}), 
    and stellar population gradients \citep[e.g.,][]{Coccato2010, Coccato2011, 
    Greene2015, Barbosa2016}. 
    \song{
    These observations are generally consistent with the two-phase formation scenario. 
    However, it is still not clear whether this picture correctly 
    predicts the connection between the stellar mass distributions in massive galaxies 
    and their dark matter haloes.}
    
     \song{In the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the assembly of massive ETGs is intrinsically 
    tied to the hierarchical growth of their host dark matter haloes 
    (e.g., \citealt{Leauthaud2012, Behroozi2013, Shankar2013}). 
    Hydrodynamic simulations suggest that the fraction of stars accreted through 
    mergers (the \textit{ex situ} component) in central galaxies increases with halo 
    mass (e.g., \citealt{RodriguezGomez2016, Pillepich2017b}). 
    The major merger rate is not a strong function of progenitor halo mass 
    (e.g., \citealt{Shankar2015}) but minor mergers can still play an important 
    role in determining the structures of central galaxies 
    (e.g., \citealt{Guo2011, Yoon2017}). 
    Minor mergers are efficient at `puffing up' the outskirts of massive 
    galaxies (e.g., \citealt{Oogi2013, Bedorf2013}). 
    Because the minor merger rate increases with halo mass, the 
    structures of massive ETGs and the well-known stellar mass--effective radius 
    relation (\mstar{}--$R_{\rm e}$; e.g., \citealt{Shen2003, Guo2009}) should 
    depend on their `environment'\footnote{There are multiple definitions of 
    `environment' in the literature. 
    In this work, we use `environment' and halo mass interchangeably.}
    (e.g., \citealt{Shankar2013, Shankar2014}). 
    However, evidence for the environment-dependence of \mstar{}--$R_{\rm e}$
    at low redshift is still not very solid (\citealt{Nair2010, HCompany13}; 
    but also see \citealt{Yoon2017}), and the results at higher redshift are 
    even more unclear (e.g., \citealt{Papovich2012, Lani2013, Delaye2014}; but 
    also see \citealt{Rettura2010}).
    }
	
	\song{
    Deep images of massive galaxies can probe the outer stellar halos of massive 
    galaxies and test these predictions. 
    Unfortunately, this is observationally challenging since the stellar haloes 
    of massive galaxies can extend to $>100$ kpc (e.g., 
    \citealt{Tal2011, DSouza2014}), and their surface brightness profiles decline 
    rapidly with typical values of $\mu > 26.0$ \sb{} in $i$-band at 100 kpc and 
    at $z\sim0.3$. 
    }
    In \citet[][Paper I hereafter]{hscMassiveI}, we showed that deep, 
    multi-band imaging from the Subaru Strategic Program (SSP; \citealt{HSC-SSP,
    HSC-DR1}) using Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC; \citealt{Miyazaki2012}, 
    Miyazaki in~prep.) allows us to extract robust surface stellar
    mass density (\mden{}) profiles for {\it individual} galaxies with 
    \logms{}$>11.4$ at $0.3 < z < 0.5$ and out to 100 kpc. 
    In Paper I, we characterized the stellar mass profiles of massive ETGs and 
    showed that there is a large intrinsic scatter in the stellar haloes of
    massive galaxies on 100-kpc scales. 
    In this paper, we investigate whether the large scatter in the outer 
    profiles of massive galaxies correlates with halo mass. 
    We conclusively show that the sizes and stellar haloes of massive central galaxies 
    depend on dark matter halo mass. 
    In other words, we reveal the halo mass dependence of the mass--size relation 
    for massive ETGs.   
    
    This paper is organized as follows. 
    In \S \ref{sec:data} we briefly introduce the sample selection and the data 
    reduction processes.  
    Please refer to \citet{hscMassiveI} for more technical details.
    Our main results are presented in \S \ref{sec:result} and discussed in 
    \S \ref{sec:discussion}. 
    Our summary and conclusions are presented in \S \ref{sec:summary}.

    Magnitudes use the AB system (\citealt{Oke1983}), and are corrected for galactic 
    extinction using calibrations from \citet{Schlafly11}. 
    We assume $H_0$ = 70~km~s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, ${\Omega}_{\rm m}=0.3$, 
    and ${\Omega}_{\rm \Lambda}=0.7$.
    Stellar mass is denoted \mstar{} and has been derived using a Chabrier initial mass 
    function (IMF; \citealt{Chabrier2003}). Halo mass is defined as 
    $M_{\rm 200b}\equiv M(<r_{\rm 200b})=200\bar{\rho} 
    \frac{4}{3}\pi r_{\rm 200b}^3$, where $r_{\rm 200b}$
    is the radius at which the mean interior density is equal to 200 times
    the mean matter density ($\bar{\rho}$). 
    As in \citet{hscMassiveI}, we do not attempt to decompose or distinguish any  
    potential `intra-cluster' 
    component (ICL; e.g., \citealt{Carlberg1997, Lin2004, Gonzalez2005, Mihos2005}).

\section{Sample Selection and Data Reduction}
    \label{sec:data}
    
    We refer the reader to Paper I for an in-depth description of the sample selection 
    and data reduction processes. 
    Here, we briefly summarize the main steps.
    
    We use imaging data from the HSC internal data release 
    \texttt{S15B}, which is very similar to the Public Data Release 1 
    (\citealt{HSC-DR1} and covers ${\sim} 110$ deg$^2$ in all five-band ($grizy$) to 
    the full depth in the wide field. 
    The data are reduced by \texttt{hscPipe 4.0.2}, a derivative of the 
    Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) pipeline (e.g.\ \citealt{Juric2015}; 
    \citealt{Axelrod2010}), modified for HSC (\citealt{HSC-PIPE}).
    The pixel scale of the reduced image is $0.168$\asec{}.
    We use $i$-band images for extracting surface brightness profiles. 
    HSC $i$-band images are typically 3--4 mag deeper than SDSS 
    (Sloan Digital Sky Survey; e.g., \citealt{SDSS-DR7, SDSS-DR8, SDSS-DR12})  
    and have superb seeing conditions (mean $i$-band seeing has FWHM$=0.6$\asec{}).
    
    In Paper~I, we select a sample of 25286 bright galaxies with spectroscopic 
    redshifts or reliable `red-sequence' photometric redshifts (\citealt{Rykoff2014}) 
    at $0.3<z<0.5$. 
    Within this redshift range, we have a large enough volume 
    ($\sim5\times 10^6$ Mpc$^3$) to sample the galaxy stellar mass function above 
    \logms$>11.6$, and we can spatially resolve galaxies profiles to $\sim 5$ kpc 
    ($1.0^{\arcsec}$ corresponds to 4.4 and 6.1 kpc at $z=0.3$ and 0.5). 
    \song{
    Massive galaxies should experience little structural evolution and 
    size growth between $z=0.5$ and 0.3 ($\sim$1.5 Gyr time span) 
    based on model predictions (e.g., \citealt{Shankar2015}).
    }
    
    After carefully 
    masking out surrounding neighbors and accounting for the subtraction of the 
    background light, we derive $i$-band surface brightness profiles out to 100 kpc. 
    We use the broadband spectral energy distributions (SED) fitting code 
    \texttt{iSEDFit}\footnote{http://www.sos.siena.edu/~jmoustakas/isedfit/} 
    (\citealt{Moustakas13}) to measure \m2l{} ratios and $k$--corrections using 
    five-band forced \cmodel{} magnitudes from \texttt{hscPipe}. 
    We assume a \citet{Chabrier2003} IMF, the Flexible Stellar Population 
    Synthesis models\footnote{http://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy/sps-models}
    (FSPS; \texttt{v2.4}; \citealt{FSPS}, \citealt{Conroy2010}), the 
    \citet{Calzetti2000} extinction law, and a simple delayed-$\tau$ model for 
    star formation histories (SFH). 
    Using HSC data, we can measure the \mden{} profiles of massive galaxies to 
    $\sim 100$ kpc, and we integrate these profiles within elliptical isophotal
    apertures at different physical radii. 
    As explained in Paper~I, we focus on the two following metric masses:
        
    \begin{itemize}
    
        \item Stellar mass within 10 kpc (hereafter noted \minn{}), which we use 
            as a proxy for the stellar mass of the \textit{in situ} stellar 
            component. 
            This is motivated both by observations and simulations 
            (e.g.~\citealt{vanDokkum2010}, \citealt{RodriguezGomez2016}). 
            The value of 10 kpc that we quote here corresponds to the radius of the 
            major axis of the isophotal ellipse.
            
        \item Stellar mass within 100 kpc (hereafter noted \mtot{}). 
            We use \mtot{} as a proxy for the `total' stellar mass. 
            In Paper~I we show that \mtot{} recovers more light compared to 
            HSC \cmodel{} photometry with differences that can be a large as 0.2 dex 
            in magnitude.        
               
   \end{itemize}
   
   We use these two simple metric masses to explore the \mstar{}-dependence of the 
   fraction of accreted stars and to reveal the diversity of stellar envelopes among 
   massive galaxies. 
   In practice, we also have the full profiles for each galaxy and can cast our 
   results in terms of the full stellar mass profiles. 
   However, in many cases we find it useful to display figures using the simpler 
   \minn{} and \mtot{} quantities. 
   In Figure \ref{fig:m100_m10_color}, we highlight the diversity of galaxies as a 
   function of \minn{} and \mtot{}. 
   Figure \ref{fig:m100_m10_color} shows a random subsample of massive galaxies with 
   very similar \minn{} that have a large range of \mtot{}. 
   We use these two aperture masses to guide our comparison of massive galaxies 
   as a function of environment.

\subsection{Massive Central Galaxies from Different Environments}
    \label{ssec:cen}
         
    In this work, we focus on massive galaxies with \mtot{} $>10^{11.6}$~\msun{}. 
    In Paper~I, we demonstrate that this sample is almost mass complete over our full 
    redshift range. 
    In addition to the mass cut above, we also limit our sample to galaxies that live 
    at the centers of their own dark matter haloes -- so-called `central' galaxies. 
    We use the \redm{} \texttt{v5.10} \citep{Rykoff2014, Rozo2015b} cluster catalogue 
    to help us construct two central galaxy samples.
    
    %Central galaxies are important to the study of galaxy-halo connection and follow 
    %stellar mass--halo mass relation (SHMR; e.g., \citealt{Leauthaud2012, 
    %Behroozi2013, Kravtsov2014, Tinker2017}) at high-\mstar{}.
 
    First, we build a sample of central galaxies in high mass haloes. We select 68 massive central galaxies from \redm{} clusters 
    with richness $\lambda \geq 30$, with central probability $P_{\mathrm{Cen}} \geq 0.7$, and \logmtot{}$ >11.5$ 
    at $0.3 < z < 0.5$ (63/68 have \logmtot{}$ >11.6$). 
    This $\lambda$ limit is chosen to mitigate incompleteness in the cluster catalogue
    at the high end of our redshift window. 
    The $P_{\mathrm{Cen}}$ limit is imposed to limit our sample to central galaxies. 
    \song{
    \citet{Simet2017} present a calibration of the \mhalo{}-$\lambda$ relation for \redm{} 
    clusters using SDSS weak-lensing. Based on this calibration, our sample corresponds to central galaxies living 
    in haloes with \mhalo{}$>10^{14.2}$~\msun{}. 
    This calibration is consistent with several other independent calibrations 
    using different methods (e.g., \citealt{Saro2015, Farahi2016, 
    Melchior2016, Murata2017}). 
    }
    The median richness of the sample is $\lambda \approx 41$ 
    (\mhalo{}$\approx 2.2 \times 10^{14}$~\msun{}), and there are 44 central galaxies in clusters with $\lambda>50$ 
    (\mhalo{}$\approx 3.0 \times 10^{14}$~\msun{}).
    We refer to this sample of \textbf{central galaxies in massive haloes} as 
    the \rbcg{} sample.
    
    Second, we build a sample of central galaxies in low mass haloes. We begin by excluding all galaxies in \redm{} clusters with $\lambda > 20$.
    \song{
    We convert $\lambda$ to $M_{\mathrm{200b}}$ using the \citet{Simet2017} calibration. For each cluster, we compute $R_{\mathrm{200b}}$ using the \texttt{Colossus} Python package 
    (\citealt{Colossus})\footnote{\url{http://www.benediktdiemer.com/code/colossus/}}
    provided by \citet{Diemer2015}} 
    We exclude all galaxies within a cylinder around each cluster, with a radius
    equal to $R_{\mathrm{200b}}$, and a length equal to twice the value of the 
    photometric redshift uncertainty of the cluster (typically around 0.015 to 0.025).
    This second sample is dominated by central galaxies living in haloes with
    $M_{\mathrm{200b}} < 10^{14}$~\msun{}; we refer to this sample as \nbcg{}. \
    There are 833 central galaxies with \logmtot{}$> 11.6$ in this sample.

    Satellite contamination in our sample should be low (e.g., \citealt{Reid2014, Hoshino2015, Saito2016, vanUitert2016}). 
    For instance, the model from \citet{Saito2016} predicts that our \rbcg{} sample should only contain $\sim 7$\% satellites (corresponding to satellites with \logmtot{}$>11.6$ and living in haloes with \logmh$<14.0$).
    
    Appendix~\ref{app:basic} shows the distributions of redshift, \mtot{}, and 
    \minn{} for the two samples. 
    We also compare these two samples on a \mtot{} versus rest--frame $(g-r)$ colour 
    plane. 
    Both samples follow the same red-sequence, with only a handful of galaxies 
    displaying bluer colours.
    
    Our analysis fails to extract 1-D profiles for $\sim10$\% of 
    \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies due to ongoing major mergers or projection effects 
    (e.g.\ nearby foreground galaxy or bright stars). 
    However, this small failure rate should not affect any of our results.

\section{Results}
    \label{sec:result}
    
    As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:m100_m10_color}, massive central galaxies at fixed  
    \minn{} display a large diversity in their stellar haloes. 
    In Paper~I, we explored the \mstar{}-dependence of these stellar haloes. We now investigate the relation between \mden{} profiles, stellar haloes, and dark matter halo mass. We remind the reader that although a circular aperture is shown on 
    Fig~\ref{fig:m100_m10_color}, in practice we extract 1-D \mden{} profiles and 
    estimate \mtot{} and \minn{} using elliptical apertures following the average 
    flux-weighted isophotal shape.

\subsection{Environmental Dependence of the Stellar Mass Density Profiles of Massive 
            Galaxies}
    \label{ssec:sbp_mtot} 
       
    First, we ask whether the \mden{} profiles of massive central galaxies depend on 
    halo mass at fixed stellar mass.    
    We show comparisons of \mden{} profiles at both fixed \mtot{} and fixed 
    \minn{}. All comparisons are performed with a fixed underlying redshift
    distribution by matching samples in redshift in addition to stellar mass
    (see Appendix~\ref{app:match}, Appendix~\ref{app:redshift}, 
    and Fig~\ref{fig:match} for details). 
   
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%     
    Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1} compares the \mden{} profiles of massive central galaxies in low mass haloes to those in high mass haloes at fixed \mtot{} (left panel) and at fixed \minn{} (right panel). The left panel compares galaxies that have similar `total' stellar mass. The right panel uses \minn{} as a proxy for the \textit{in situ} component to 
    compare the profiles of galaxies that presumably have similar early formation histories, but which live in different dark matter haloes today. This figure shows the main result of this paper, namely that 
    \emph{the \mden{} profiles of massive central galaxies show a clear dependence on 
    dark matter halo mass at both fixed \mtot{} and \minn{}.}

    \song{
    We estimate the uncertainties of the median \mden{} profiles using a bootstrap 
    resampling test, and we perform statistical tests to demonstrate that the 
    difference between the profiles is more significant than the level allowed by 
    the intrinsic randomness within the combined \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} sample. 
    }
    We also conduct a variety of tests that verify the robustness of these results with
    respect to our \mtot{} binning scheme, $\lambda$ cut, the redshift range, and the 
    choice of apertures used for the metric masses. 
    Please see Appendix~\ref{app:robust} for further details.
    \song{Appendix \ref{app:cog} and Figure~\ref{fig:cog} compares the same 
    \mtot{}-matched samples using cumulative \mstar{} profiles (`curve of growth') 
    and the fraction of \mtot{} enclosed within different radii.
    Both comparisons highlight the differences in the median \mden{} profiles 
    from different angles.   
    }
   
    The key features in Figure~\ref{fig:prof_1} are the following:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        
        \item At fixed \mtot{}, central galaxies in high mass haloes 
            display shallower \mden{} profiles compared to those in low mass haloes (i.e., they have flatter inner \mden{} profiles and 
            more significant outer stellar envelopes). 
            
            \item  The median \mden{} profiles of the two samples cross 
            each other at ${\sim} 15$-20 kpc, roughly the typical effective radius 
            ($R_{\mathrm{e}}$) of galaxies at these masses (\logmtot{}$>11.7$--11.8).  
                        
            \item \song{
            When matched by \mtot{}, differences in the inner regions appear 
            to be small, but this is also driven by the use of a logarithmic y-axis. The difference becomes more apparent 
            at $R>50$ kpc.  
            }
                                
        \item Massive galaxies matched by \minn{} display a range of  \mtot{} values. Those in massive dark matter halos have more prominent outer stellar haloes. The scatter in the outer profiles observed in Figure \ref{fig:prof_1} is an \textit{intrinsic} scatter (not measurement error).                     
    \end{itemize}

    \song{
    Fig \ref{fig:prof_1} shows that the environmental dependence of the profiles of massive central galaxies is a subtle effect that is most prominent at large radii ($R>50$ kpc).
    } This may explain why previous attempts to detect this effect using 
    shallower images have often failed. 
    
    The effect becomes more pronounced for even more massive galaxies. This is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:prof_2} in Appendix~\ref{app:robust}.
    
    In summary, we detect a subtle, but robust halo mass dependence of 
    the profiles of massive central galaxies. 
    This dependence could be driven by the fact that massive halos have a larger minor 
    merger rate compared to less massive haloes. 
    Nondissipative (minor) mergers should not strongly alter inner 
    profiles, but can efficiently build up outer haloes 
    (e.g., \citealt{Hilz2013}, \citealt{Oogi2013}).

\subsection{The Environmental Dependence of Scaling Relations}
    \label{ssec:scaling}
    
    We have shown that the \mden{} profiles of massive galaxies vary with the masses of their host dark matter haloes. We now turn our attention to the more commonly studied stellar 
    mass--size relation (\mstar{}--$R_{\mathrm{e}}$). 
    In addition, we consider halo mass dependence on the 
    \mtot{}--\minn{} plane. 
    
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\subsubsection{Mass--Size Relation}
    \label{sssec:mass_size}
    
    The tight relation between \mstar{} and effective radius (or half-light radius; 
    $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ or $R_{\mathrm{50}}$; e.g., \citealt{Shankar2013, Leja2013, 
    vdWel2014}) is one of the most important scaling relationships for ETGs. 
    Despite numerous attempts, previous studies have failed to detect the 
    \mhalo{}-dependence of the \mstar{}--$R_{\mathrm{e}}$ relation at low-$z$ 
    (e.g., \citealt{Weinmann2009, Nair2010, HCompany13, Cerbrian2014}; 
    except for the recent result by \citealt{Yoon2017}). 
    
    \song{However, `size' is not a well-defined parameter for massive 
    galaxies with very extended stellar mass distributions. 
    In practice, measurements of the `effective radius', or `half-light radius', depend on resolution, depth, filter, and may also 
    depend on the adopted model for the light profile.  
    This makes comparisons of size measurements among different observations, 
    or between observations and models, uncertain. This is the main reason
    why we prefer to compare \mden{} profiles directly which completely bypasses the need to consider `size'.
    }
    
    Nonetheless, to enable comparisons with past work, we now consider the more traditional mass-size relation. We adopt the radius enclosing 50\% of stellar mass within 
    100 kpc ($R_{\mathrm{50}}$; derived from the $i$-band curve-of-growth) as our 
    `size' for massive galaxies. This definition of `half-light radius' is more robust against structural 
    details, model choice, and background subtraction, compared to the 
    effective radius measured using oversimplified 2-D models such as the single-\ser{} model. 
    Massive galaxies in this sample are large enough so that the impact of seeing 
    is not a concern.
    
    The left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:scaling_relation} shows the mass-size relation for our two samples. We fit the \logmtot{}-$\log_{10} (R_{\mathrm{50}}/\mathrm{kpc})$ relations at 
    $\log(M_{\star,100})>11.6$ using the \texttt{emcee} MCMC sampler 
    (\citealt{Emcee})\footnote{The initial guesses are based on maximum 
    likelihood estimates, and we assume flat priors for parameters.}.
    \song{
    Uncertainties in both \mtot{} and $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ are considered. 
    For \logmtot{}$>11.6$ galaxies, the typical uncertainty for mass is $\sim 0.12$
    dex.  
    The $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ uncertainty is based on the \mden{} profile and
    is very small due to the high \s2n{} of the profile. 
    We manually assign a 10\% error for $R_{\mathrm{50}}$. 
    }
    
    The best-fitting relation for \rbcg{} is:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log_{10} (R_{\mathrm{50}}/\mathrm{kpc}) = & (0.74\pm0.13) \times \log_{10} (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & -(7.56\pm1.56)
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

    \noindent And for \nbcg{}, we find:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log_{10} (R_{\mathrm{50}}/\mathrm{kpc}) = & (0.68\pm0.06) \times \log_{10} (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & -(6.88\pm0.75)
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    
    \noindent As shown in the left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:scaling_relation}, the two samples lie on 
    \mtot{}--$R_{\mathrm{50}}$ relations that have similar slopes but 
    different normalizations. The best-fitting mass--size relation derived here suggests that, 
    at $0.3 < z < 0.5$, central galaxies with \logmtot{}$>11.6$ in \logmhalo{}$>14.2$
    haloes are on average $\sim20$\% larger than centrals in \logmhalo{}$<14.0$
    haloes at fixed \mtot{}.
    This result is robust against the stellar mass range over which the fit is 
    performed and against the definitions of  `total' \mstar{} and half-light 
    radius\footnote{Using \mstar{} within 120 or 150 kpc, or using the 
    $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ derived within these apertures does not change the results.}. 
    
    \song{
    Due to the steep slope of the mass--size relation, secondary binning 
    (e.g., different halo mass) may introduce artificial differences 
    (e.g., \citealt{Sonnenfeld2017}).
    Besides the differences in best--fit \mtot{}--$R_{\mathrm{50}}$ relation, the 
    median $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ of the \mtot{}-matched samples also confirm the above 
    conclusion. 
    In addition, we use the normalized size parameter ($\gamma$; e.g., 
    \citealt{Newman2012, HCompany13}) to further test our results. 
    In \citet{HCompany13}, $\gamma$ is defined as:
    }
    
    \begin{equation}
        \log_{10}(\gamma) = \log_{10} (R_{\mathrm{50}}) + \beta (11 - \log_{10}M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}),
    \end{equation}
    
    \song{
    where $\beta$ is the slope of the mass--size relation.
    We estimate the average $\gamma$ of both samples at \logmtot{}$>11.6$. 
    For \rbcg{}, $<\gamma> = 4.2\pm0.4$ and for \nbcg{}, 
    $<\gamma> = 3.8\pm0.3$. 
    The environmental dependence of $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ at fixed \mtot{} is more 
    significant than the \citet{HCompany13} result but weaker than some 
    model predictions (e.g., \citealt{Shankar2014}).}
    %It is important to remember that the uncertainties in both mass and size can 
    %wash out signals of stronger environment--dependence on mass--size plane 
    %(e.g., \citealt{HCompany13}), and direct comparison of \mden{} profiles or 
    %the \mtot{}--\minn{} relation may serve as a better tracer of the environment 
    %dependence. 
    %}
    
    \song{
    We qualitatively compare our results with the mass--size relation for 
    $0.2 < z < 0.5$ ETGs in group-scale dark matter halos in COSMOS (\citealt{HueartasCompany2013b}; HC13a; cyan dashed line).
    HC13a measure luminosities and sizes using 2--D 
    single--\ser{} models applied to \textit{HST}/ACS \texttt{F814W} images. HC13a use circularized effective radii 
    ($R_{\mathrm{e,Circ}} = R_{\mathrm{e,Fit}} \times \sqrt{b/a}$). We empirically correct their measurements assuming an average $<b/a>=0.75$.
    At similar redshifts, the mass-size relation from HC13a lies below our 
    best--fit relation but the slopes are similar.
    }
    
    \song{
    We also compare with results from \citealt{HCompany13} (HC13b; green dashed line), 
    who studied $z\leq 0.09$ central ETGs in $12.5 \le$ \logmh{} $< 15$ haloes. 
    HC13b use the \citet{Yang2007} group catalog to estimate halo mass. 
    In contrast to the present study, HC13b find no environment dependence in the 
    mass--size relation for central galaxies. 
    They obtain effective radii from single-\ser{} model fitting to SDSS 
    images and derive stellar mass based on SED fitting using the BC03 (\citealt{BC03}) 
    synthetic population model. 
    We convert the HC13b \mstar{} estimates from a Kroupa IMF to a Chabrier 
    IMF by applying a constant $-0.05$ dex shift (see \citealt{Bernardi2016a}). 
    We further add $+0.1$dex to the HSC13 stellar masses to account for a systematic 
    offset between BC03 and our FSPS model (see Paper~1). Our overall mass-size relation is in good agreement with HC13a.}
    
    \song{
    Differences between the HC13ab and our results may relate to differences 
    in modeling methods, and to the shallower ACS/\texttt{F814W} imaging. 
    As for HC13b, it is also possible that the shallower SDSS image masks the environmental dependence. Figure~\ref{fig:prof_1} shows that the most pronounced differences are at $R>50$ kpc -- these would be difficult to detect with shallow imaging. Both shallow images and oversimplified models can lead to biased results. We highlight such effects in Appendix~\ref{app:gama} by comparing luminosities from HSC to those from single-\ser{} model applied to SDSS.

\subsubsection{\mtot{} - \minn{} Relation}
    \label{sssec:m100_m10}
    
    We now investigate the relationship between \mtot{}, \minn{}, and \mhalo{}. 
    Compared to the mass--size relation, the \mtot{}--\minn{} relation is not plagued 
    by the ambiguity of galaxy `size', and it also enables a more straightforward 
    comparison with numerical simulations.
    
    The right panel of Fig \ref{fig:scaling_relation} compares our two samples on the \mtot{}--\minn{} plane. The two samples follow distinct best-fitting \mtot{}--\minn{} relations. 
    For \rbcg{} galaxies with \logmtot{}$>11.6$ we find:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log_{10} (M_{\star, 10\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) = & (0.48\pm0.06) \times \log_{10} (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & +(5.72\pm0.75).
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    
    \noindent In the same range of \mtot{}, the best-fitting relation for \nbcg{} is:
     
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
        \log_{10} (M_{\star, 10\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) = & (0.56\pm0.03) \times \log_{10} (M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) \\ & +(4.82\pm0.30).
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    
    These results are robust against the exact choice of the stellar mass range over which

\subsection{Ellipticity and Colour Profiles}
    \label{ssec:ell_color}
    
    In Paper~I, we show that the ellipticity of the outer stellar halo increases with stellar mass but that rest-frame colour gradients do not depend strongly on stellar mass. In this paper, we take this analysis one step further to investigate whether either 
    of these quantities depends on halo mass. 
    We focus on ellipticity and colour profiles within 5--60 kpc where we can ignore
    differences in sky subtraction and seeing across different filters. 
    Galactic extinction and $k$ corrections are applied to both $(g-r)$ and $(g-i)$ 
    colour profiles.
    
    Figure \ref{fig:ell_color} shows the average ellipticity, $g-r$, and $g-i$ colour 
    profiles for galaxies at fixed \mtot{} and fixed \minn{}. Our main findings are: 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \song{
            The ellipticity profiles of massive central galaxies do not depend on 
            halo mass at fixed \mtot{} at $R<60$ kpc (upper left panel). 
            }       
                
        \item \song{
            However, we do find that at fixed \minn{}, galaxies in massive halos have more elliptical outer stellar halos compared to galaxies in low mass halos (upper right panel). This may be further evidence that elongated outer stellar haloes are built from accreted stars.
            }
                     
        \item We find no evidence that the rest-frame colour gradients (at $r<60$ kpc) of massive galaxies depend on halo mass. 
            
    \end{itemize}
    
    The fact that we find smooth ellipticity profiles and shallow gradients favors 
    the idea of using a flux-weighted average isophotal shape to extract 1-D \mden{} 
    profiles for massive galaxies. The similarity in the average rest-frame colour profiles demonstrates that our results can not simply be explained by differences in radial \m2l{} ratios between the two samples.
    
    \song{
    Our work does not address color gradients below 5--6 kpc because we do not deconvolve 
    for the PSF. 
    Color gradients on these scales may be sensitive to other physical processes and 
    deserve future investigation using 2-D modelling methods and/or images with higher 
    spatial resolution.

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\subsection{The Role of Environment in the Two-Phase Formation Scenario}
            
    Using deep images from the HSC survey, we show that the stellar mass distributions 
    of massive central galaxies at $0.3 < z < 0.5$ depend on halo mass. At fixed total galaxy mass, central galaxies in massive halos have larger half-light radii and host more prominent outer 
    stellar haloes compared to galaxies in low mass haloes. We also find that 
    the outer stellar haloes ($R>50$ kpc) of massive galaxies show the strongest 
    variations with halo mass. 
    
    \song{
    The two-phase formation scenario can qualitatively explain these results. 
    In this scenario, intense dissipative processes at $z > 2$ are responsible for the 
    formation of \textit{in situ} stars in massive central galaxies. 
    After a rapid quenching of star formation, the subsequent assembly of massive galaxiesis  dominated by the accretion of satellite galaxies through (mostly) 
    non--dissipative mergers. 
    Dry minor mergers are efficient at depositing \textit{ex situ} stars in the 
    outskirts of massive galaxies (e.g., \citealt{Oogi2013, Bedorf2013}) and hence in building up outer stellar haloes. The fact that minor mergers become more frequent in more massive dark matter haloes could lead to the halo mass dependence of galaxy profiles that we identify in Figure~\ref{fig:prof_1}.}
      
    \citet{Shankar2014} studied the environment dependence of galaxy size using semi-analytic models. 
    They predict that at fixed stellar mass, the median size of central galaxies 
    should increase strongly with halo mass. 
    \song{
    Although the major-merger rate does not strongly depend on halo mass 
    (mass ratio $>1$:3; e.g., \citealt{Hirschmann2013, Shankar2015}), the 
    minor--merger rate could still increase with halo mass if the dynamical friction
    timescale is short (e.g., \citealt{Newman2012}). Massive central galaxies with $11.5 <$\logms{}$<12.0$ living in haloes with \logmh{}$>14.0$ can have up to four times more minor mergers (1:100--1:3) compared to those in less massive haloes at fixed galaxy mass. An increase in the minor-merger rate as a function of halo mass can lead to a 
    halo-mass dependence in the mass--size relation. 
    }
    The predictions from \citet{Shankar2014} have been confirmed by \citet{Yoon2017} 
    using the semi-analytic model from \citet{Guo2011}.  
    
    \song{
    Our results are broadly consistent with these predictions. However, our results alone cannot rule out other explanations for this halo mass dependence. For instance, \citet{Buchan2016} suggest that central galaxies in more massive haloes have more extended in-situ components. Comparisons with higher redshift observations will enable us to distinguish between these two formation scenarios.
    }

\subsection{The Inner Regions of Massive Galaxies}

Figure \ref{fig:scaling_relation} shows that, at fixed total galaxy mass, centrals in high mass haloes have slightly shallower inner \mden{} slopes lower values of \minn{} compared to those in low mass haloes. \song{We have tested that this cannot be solely explained by the choice of a finite aperture (100 kpc) to estimate `total' galaxy mass. Integrating our profiles our to larger radii makes the differences between \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies on the \mtot{}--\minn{} 
    plane even more significant \alexie{reference to somewhere in the appendix?}. In hydrodynamic simulations, intense dissipative processes help create a self-similar de~Vaucouleurs--like ($n{\sim} 4$) inner density profile (e.g., \citealt{Hopkins2008}). However, there are a variety of physical processes that can shape and alter the inner  profile which we now discuss.
    } 
    
    First, major mergers can redistribute the inner stellar mass distributions, but 
    the major--merger rate does not strongly depend on halo mass 
    (e.g., \citealt{Shankar2014}). 
    However, minor mergers, which do depend on halo mass, can also modify central 
    surface brightness profiles (e.g., \citealt{BoylanKolchin2007}). 
    Depending on the structure, and the orbits of infalling satellites, a minor merger 
    can make the inner \mden{} profiles either steeper or shallower.  
    Interestingly, \citet{BoylanKolchin2007} find that when a satellite is accreted 
    from a highly eccentric and energetic orbit to a core--elliptical galaxy, the 
    process tends to reduce the central \mden{}.  
    This is relevant here, as many massive ETGs are known to be core--elliptical 
    galaxies. 
    
    \song{Second, strong adiabatic expansion induced by powerful AGN feedback is another mechanism 
    (e.g., \citealt{Fan2008}) that can modify stellar density profiles. \
    When the induced mass loss is efficient enough, it can lead to expanded 
    central stellar mass distribution and can significantly lower the inner \mden{}. 
    } \alexie{Need reference also to Martizzi et al}
    
    Finally, the coalescence of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) can also flatten 
    the central \mden{} profile via an efficient scattering effect 
    (e.g., \citealt{Milosavljevi2002}).
    On the right side of Fig \ref{fig:scaling_relation}, there are a few candidates 
    for galaxies with large cores. 
    These may be similar to the recently discovered massive brightest cluster galaxies 
    (BCGs) with very large depleted cores (a few thousand parsecs; e.g., 
    \citealt{Postman2012, LopezCruz2014, Thomas2016, Bonfini2016}) possibly resulting 
    from SMBH mergers.
    
    \song{
    The impact of these processes on \mden{} profiles and their dependency on 
    halo mass are important questions that warrant further investigation.}

\subsection{Comparison with Previous Work} 

    Many previous studies that focused on the mass--size relation found this relation 
    to be independent of halo mass or environment at $z\sim 0.0$ 
    (e.g., \citealt{Nair2010, Maltby2010, Cappellari2013, HCompany13}). Shallow imaging and the use of models which do not necessarily well describe massive galaxies (e.g., single-\ser{} or de~Vaucouleurs models) may of masked the effect revealed in this paper. In Appendix~\ref{app:gama}, we use the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies that overlap 
    with the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey to demonstrate this point. 
    We show that, for galaxies with similar \mstar{} derived from single-\ser{} 
    models using shallower SDSS images (\citealt{Kelvin2012}), the ones in more 
    massive dark matter haloes actually show more prominent outer stellar haloes.
    \song{These types of issues complicate the comparisons of mass--size relations derived from different images or using different methods. For this reason, we only present a qualitative comparison with previous work}
    
    At low redshift, \citet{Cerbrian2014} find ETGs with \logms{}$>11.5$ to be slightly larger in more massive haloes, and they also show that this trend is 
    reversed at lower \mstar{}. 
    \song{
    \citet{Kuchner2017} use one massive cluster at $z=0.44$ to show that ETGs in 
    that cluster have larger sizes than ETGs in the `field'. 
    }
    \citet{Yoon2017} present a study of a large sample of $z\sim0.1$ SDSS 
    ETGs using a nonparametric method. They also find an environmental dependence of the mass--size relation at \logms{}$>11.2$. Similar to our work, they find that massive ETGs in dense environments 
    are 20--40\% larger compared to those in underdense environments.
    Recently, \citet{Charlton2017} use a single-\ser{} model for galaxies at 
    $0.2 < z < 0.8$ in the Canada France Hawaii Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) 
    (\citealt{Heymans2012}) together with galaxy--galaxy 
    lensing measurements to show that larger galaxies tend to live in more massive 
    dark matter haloes (also see \citealt{Sonnenfeld2017}).
    These results are in broad agreement with those presented here.
    
    \alexie{this needs rewritting, redshift evolution ...}\song{With a greater number of studies that are now beginning to reveal the halo mass dependence of the sizes and profiles of massive galaxies, more detailed comparisons with theoretical predictions for this effect will become of increasing interest.  Some theoretical studies predicts a strong environmental dependence of the mass--size relation 
    for massive quiescent or early-type galaxies
    (e.g., \citealt{Papovich2012, Bassett2013, Lani2013, Strazzullo2013, 
    Delaye2014}), while other observations suggest otherwise (e.g., 
    \citealt{Rettura2010, Raichoor2012, Kelkar2015, Allen2015}). 
    Comparison with high--redshift results are complicated by many issues and 
    is beyond the scope of this work, but we want to emphasize again that 
    direct comparison of \mden{} profile (e.g., \citealt{Szomoru2012, Patel2013, 
    Buitrago2017, Hill2017}) could better trace the redshift evolution of the
    environment dependence. 
    }
    
    %\song{
    %It is interesting to see that several of these works report stronger 
    %environment dependence of size at fixed \mstar{} for either ETGs or quiescent 
    %galaxies (30--50\% larger in denser environments).
    %As shown in \citet{HCompany13} using a Monte Carlo test (see their \S~4.2), 
    %when the uncertainties of mass and size are considered, the size difference at 
    %fixed stellar mass could be even more significant between extremely different
    %environments.
    %If true, it indicates that denser regions at high redshift ($z>2$) could accelerate 
    %galaxy evolution (e.g., proto-clusters; see \citealt{Wang2016, Shimakawa2018}), and

    %toward lower redshift (e.g., \citealt{Papovich2012, Andreon2016}.
    %}
    %However, there are also observations that suggest otherwise (e.g., 
    %\citealt{Rettura2010, Raichoor2012, Kelkar2015, Allen2015}).

    %Comparisons of our results with work done at high redshift are complicated by many

    %a better approach than the 
    %mass--size relation to compare high- and low-$z$ mass galaxies.

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
\subsection{Towards Consistent Size Definitions}
        
    Until recently, semi-analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations have had
    difficulty reproducing the mass--size relation of massive galaxies. 
    Galaxy sizes are sensitive to many different physical processes (star-formation, 
    feedback, mergers), and matching the galaxy stellar-mass function does not 
    automatically guarantee a match to the mass--size relation. 
    Furthermore, while some effort have been made to use consistent size definitions 
    (\citealt{McCarthy2017}), more often than not, comparisons of the mass--size relation 
    do not use consistent size definitions, or they only perform crude size conversions 
    (e.g., 3-D radii in simulation versus 2-D projected radii in observation; 
    \citealt{Genel2017}). 
    Observers often quote `sizes' corresponding to the half-light radius along the 
    major axis using 2-D projected images. 
    Simulations, on the other hand, often employ sizes that correspond to the 3-D 
    aperture half-mass radius (e.g., \citealt{Price2017}). 
    
    As emphasized earlier, definitions of galaxy `size' in observations are also not 
    always consistent. 
    Measurements of `size' depend on image quality (e.g., seeing, imaging depth), filter, 
    and the adopted method. 
    Although the elliptical single-\ser{} model is widely adopted in measuring the 
    size of galaxies of different types and at different redshifts, it sometimes leads
    to biased results as it does not universally describe all types of galaxies. Sizes derived from 1-D curves-of-growth are more model independent and have been 
    shown to be useful in revealing the environmental dependence of the mass--size relation 
    (e.g., \citealt{Yoon2017}, and this work), but this method does not take the PSF into account. It also depends on imaging depth and background subtraction.

    In this paper, we quote stellar masses measured within elliptical apertures of 
    fixed physical size. 
    We argue that this approach will allow for a more straightforward comparison 
    between observations and theoretical predictions. Even better, we argue that galaxy mass profiles can be compared directly with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations, bypassing the need completely for `size' estimates.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}
    \label{sec:summary}
    
    In this paper, we investigate how the stellar mass profiles of massive galaxies depend on the masses of their host dark matter haloes. Using high-quality images from the first $\sim100$ deg$^2$ of the 
    Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program, we divide central galaxies at $0.3 < z < 0.5$ into two samples according to dark matter halo mass (\mhalo{}$\simgt 10^{14.2} M_{\odot}$ and 
    \mhalo{}$\simlt 10^{14} M_{\odot}$). Exquisite data from HSC enables us to extract stellar profiles for individual galaxies in these two samples out to 100 kpc.
    
    Our main results are as follows:  
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    
    \item At fixed \mtot{}, central galaxies in high mass haloes 
            display shallower \mden{} profiles compared to those in low mass haloes: they have flatter inner \mden{} profiles and 
            more significant outer stellar envelopes.  This trend is most pronounced at $R>50$ kpc and thus would easily be missed with shallow imaging data.                 
                                
        \item Massive galaxies matched by \minn{} display a range of  \mtot{} values and a large intrinsic scatter in the amplitude of their outer stellar envelopes. 
              
            
        %\item At fixed \minn{}, massive central galaxies in more massive haloes 
          %  possess much more extended stellar haloes than those in smaller haloes. 
         %   Assuming that \minn{} traces the amount of `\textit{in situ}' stars in 
          %  massive galaxies, this result is consistent with the picture that more 
          %  massive haloes favor the growth of extended stellar haloes in their central 
           % galaxies through more frequent mergers. 
        
        \item \song{This environmental dependence is also reflected in the mass-size relation, as well as in the \mtot{}-\minn{} relation. We propose that simple elliptical aperture masses such as \mtot{} and\minn{} are better statistics to summarize the properties of galaxy profiles than commonly used `size' estimates such as $R_e$.}
      
      \item \song{At fixed \minn{}, galaxies in massive halos have more elliptical outer stellar halos compared to galaxies in low mass halos. This may be further evidence that elongated outer stellar haloes are built from accreted stars.}
                     
        \item At fixed galaxy mass and at $r<60$ kpc, the rest-frame colour gradients of massive galaxies do not depend on dark matter halo mass. 
             
    \end{enumerate}
    
    These results highlight the importance of deep, high-quality images for studying 
    the assembly of massive dark matter haloes and their central galaxies. Future work will focus on a comparison between our data and  predictions from various hydrodynamic simulations. This will enable us to gain further insight into the physical mechanisms that drive the trends discovered in this paper.

    On the top-left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:sample_stats}, we show the \mtot{}-colour 
    relations using the $k$-corrected $g-r$ colour. 
    Both samples follow the same tight `red-sequence' with little contamination 
    from the `blue cloud'.
    At fixed \mtot{}, we see little offset in colour distributions of the two 
    samples, suggesting that both samples consist of quiescent galaxies with 
    similar average stellar population properties.  
    This is consistent with previous result that suggests the average stellar 
    population of massive central galaxy does not depend on \mhalo{} 
    (e.g.\ \citealt{Park2007}).  
    In this work, we focus on the \mstar{} range of $11.6 \le$\logmtot{}$\le 11.9$, 
    where both samples have acceptable completeness, and their \mtot{} distributions 
    greatly overlap (see the normalized distributions of \mtot{} in the bottom-left 
    panel of Fig~\ref{fig:sample_stats}). 
    As for the \minn{} distributions, the two samples overlap the most within 
    $11.2 \le$\logmtot{}$\le 11.6$, but now they show quite different
    distributions (bottom-right figure).
    
    The redshift distributions also show small difference
    (upper-right panel) even in the high-\mtot{} bin, where the redshift distribution 
    of the \nbcg{} sample skews toward higher-$z$ end due to the contribution of BOSS 
    spec-$z$.
    Since this could bias the comparison of \mden{} profiles and other properties 
    (please see Appendix\ref{app:redshift} for more details), we address this via matching 
    the two samples in both mass and redshift distributions carefully
    (see Appendix~\ref{app:match}).

        \mtot{} in the top and middle panels.}

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
    Given the redshift range for our samples, it is important to evaluate 
    the impacts from the physical extend of seeing and the imaging depth on the \mden{} 
    profiles at different redshift. 
    Under the same seeing, the \mden{} profile of galaxy at higher-$z$ is more 
    vulnerable to the PSF smearing effect at the center. 
    It is also harder to reach to the same \mden{} level under the same imaging depth 
    due to cosmological dimming and background noise. 
    
    In Fig~\ref{fig:avg_prof_z}, we group the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies within 
    $11.6 \le$\logmtot$< 11.9$ into two $z$ bins ($0.3\leq z<0.4$ and $0.4\leq z<0.5$),
    and compare their \mden{} profiles. 
    In two redshift bins, the median \mden{} profiles from the same sample follow each 
    other very well outside 10 kpc, but become visibly different in the central 3-4 kpc,
    where the effect from seeing kicks in. 
    Meanwhile, the median \mden{} profiles of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} in the same $z$ bin 
    are identical in the central region, which indicates similar average seeing 
    conditions.       
    This confirms that \mden{} profile at $> 5$ kpc is safe from the impacts of seeing 
    and difference in redshift.
    More importantly, it also suggests that, once the redshift distributions are 
    carefully matched, the difference of \mden{} profile is likely to be physical 
    even in the central region.

\section{Match the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} samples in \mstar{} and redshift distributions}
    \label{app:match} 

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 

    As explained earlier, it is important to make sure the two samples have similar 
    distributions in both \mstar{} and redshift before comparing their median \mden{} 
    profiles.  
    Here we briefly describe the procedure used in this work. 
    Since the \rbcg{} sample is smaller in size, we always match the \nbcg{} sample to 
    it by searching for the $N$-nearest neighbours on the $M_{\star}$-redshift plane 
    using the KDTree algorithm in the \texttt{scikit-learn} Python library 
    (\citealt{scikit-learn}), and evaluate the quality of the match using the 
    distributions of both parameters (as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:match}). 
 
    As we only keep the unique \nbcg{} galaxies in the matched sample, we manually 
    adjust the value of $N$ to achieve the best match. 
    When the redshift distribution of the \rbcg{} sample becomes bi-model, we also try 
    to split the sample into two redshift bins and match them separately. 
    Typically $N$ is between 3 to 8.
    In Fig~\ref{fig:match}, we demonstrate this procedure using the results for 
    the \mtot{}-matched (Left) and the \minn{}-matched samples in Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}
    (Right), and the two samples are well matched in the distributions of \mtot{}
    (or \minn{}) and redshift.  
    For all the comparisons of \mden{} profiles in this work, we match the samples 
    in the same way, and make sure the match has the same quality.

      \label{fig:prof_4} 
  \end{figure*}
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 

    In Fig~\ref{fig:prof_1}, we compare the \mden{} profiles of \mtot{}- and 
    \minn{}-matched samples of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies, and here we test the 
    robustness of the results using a few extra tests that are illustrated in
    Fig~\ref{fig:prof_2}, Fig~\ref{fig:prof_3}, and Fig~\ref{fig:prof_4}, and 
    are briefly described here:   
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        
        \item In Fig~\ref{fig:prof_2}, we group the samples into two \mtot{} bins. 
            Given the small sample size, we extend slightly toward lower \mtot{} range 
            ($11.5 \leq \log_{10} (M_{\star,\ 10\mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) < 11.7$ and 
             $11.7 \leq \log_{10} (M_{\star,\ 10\mathrm{kpc}}/M_{\odot}) < 11.9$). 
            Although the smaller sample leads to larger statistical uncertainties, 
            we can still see similar structural differences in both \mtot{} bins, 
            and the difference becomes more significant in the higher \mtot{} bin.  
            For the lower \mtot{} bin, the difference in the inner region becomes 
            quite uncertain, while the difference in the outskirt is still visible. 
            This potentially suggests that the environmental dependence of structure 
            also varies with \mstar{}, an important implication deserves more 
            investigations in the future.   

        \item On the left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_3}, we match the \rbcg{} and 
            \nbcg{} samples in a lower redshift bins ($0.30 < z < 0.42$).
            Despite the larger uncertainties due to smaller samples, we find the 
            results are the same.
            
        \item On the middle panel of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_3}, we includes \rbcg{} 
            galaxies in poorer clusters ($20 < \lambda < 30$), which should result 
            in overlapped \mhalo{} distributions with the \nbcg{} samples 
            considering the typical uncertainty of $\lambda$.
            This makes the difference in the inner region slightly less significant, 
            but the overall results are the same. 
             
        \item On the right panel of Fig~\ref{fig:prof_3}, in stead of using \mtot{}, 
            we use the \mmax{}--the maximum \mstar{} by integrating the \mden{} 
            profiles to the largest radius allowed.  
            The \mmax{} values are less reliable than \mtot{} due to the 
            uncertainty of background subtraction and contamination from nearby 
            bright objects, but they can serve as different estimates of the `total'
            \mstar{} of these galaxies.
            As shown in \S~\ref{sec:discussion}, they on average increase
            the \mstar{} by a little bit and affect the \rbcg{} more.
            The differences in the \mden{} profiles still remain very similar.
      
    \end{enumerate}
    
    We also test the robustness of the \mtot{}-matched results using the samples with 
    only spectroscopic redshift, the samples in the three GAMA fields, and the \rbcg{} 
    samples without the ones in very massive haloes ($\lambda > 40$).  
    Limited by space, we do not show these results here, but they all verify the 
    robustness of the results. 
    
    For the results from the \minn{}-matched samples: 
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    
        \item
            We match the two samples using both \minn{} and the \mstar{} within 15 kpc 
            at the same time.  
            This makes the two median \mden{} profiles very similar inside 10-15 
            kpc, while the result in the outskirt remains the same (left panel of 
            Fig~\ref{fig:prof_4}).
            Use \mstar{} within 5 or 20 kpc leads to the same conclusion. 
          
        \item 
            To make sure the two samples are comparable in their overall assembly history,
            we also try to only include the very massive galaxies (\logmtot{}$>11.5$)
            in both samples. 
            This excludes the \nbcg{} galaxies that are much less massive and 
            more `compact' in structure. 
            Yet, the results regarding the structural differences remain the same. 
          
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Stellar Mass Curve-of-Growth for Massive Central Galaxies} 
	\label{app:cog}
	
	In \S \ref{ssec:sbp_mtot} and Figure \ref{fig:prof_1}, we show the comparisons 
	of \mden{} profiles for massive central galaxies from the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} 
	samples. 
	Although the differences in their median \mden{} profiles we revealed are robust 
	and systematic, they appear to be very subtle, especially in the inner region. 
	This is partly due to the logarithmic scale on the Y--axis for \mden{} profiles. 
	
	In Figure \ref{fig:cog}, we compare the same two samples after converting the 
	\mden{} profiles into: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	
	    \item `Curve-of-growth' of stellar mass -- the cumulative \logms{} profiles
	        (upper panel).
	    
	    \item Fraction of \mtot{} within different radius (lower panel).
	
	\end{enumerate}
	
	These comparisons demonstrate the same results from different angles and 
	the systematic differences become more clear using the fraction of \mtot{}
	within different radius.  
	The comparison of cumulative \logms{} profiles also demonstrates that the 
	\rbcg{} and \nbcg{} samples have very similar median \mtot{}.  
    They help confirm that the distributions of stellar mass within 100 kpc indeed 
    have systematic differences between the massive central galaxies living in more 
    and less massive dark matter haloes.

\end{figure}
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %% 
    
    The GAMA survey greatly overlaps with the HSC survey, and it provides carefully 
    measured \mstar{} for large sample of galaxies (\citealt{Taylor2011}) that help 
    produce many interesting results (e.g., \citealt{Bauer2013, Ferreras2017}).
    They use 2-D single-\ser{} model to correct the total luminosity of the galaxy 
    (\citealt{Kelvin2012}), and derive the \m2l{} through optical-SED fitting 
    (BC03 model; Chabrier IMF) based on the PSF-matched aperture photometry. 
    Since the \ser{} model is generally more flexible than the \texttt{cModel} one, 
    it is therefore interesting to compare with the \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies 
    that also have spec-$z$ (at $z < 0.40$) and \mstar{} in GAMA DR2 
    (\citealt{Liske2015}) and see the impact of deep photometry again. 
    
    We summarize the results in Fig~\ref{fig:gama}.  
    On the left panel, we compare the differences between \mtot{} and \mgama{}. 
    HSC survey on average recovers more \mstar{} at high-\mstar{} end, which is 
    consistent with the expectation from deeper photometry, although the 
    systematic differences in the estimates of \m2l{} could play a role here. 
    Meanwhile, it is interesting see that, above \logmtot{}$> 11.8$, \mgama{} 
    becomes increasingly larger than \mtot{}, and most of these massive 
    galaxies have very high \ser{} index from the 2-D fitting. 
    This suggests that the single-\ser{} model is no longer an appropriate one to 
    describe very massive galaxies as it tends to over-estimate the \mstar{} the 
    inner and/or outer regions. 
    
    To verify the cause of the difference in \mstar{}, we further select samples 
    of \rbcg{} and \nbcg{} galaxies with matched \mgama{} and redshift 
    distributions (at $11.4 <$\logmgama{}$<11.8$; see Appendix \ref{app:match}), 
    and compare their \mden{} profiles (right panel). 
    Although these two subsamples are equally massive according to results from 
    GAMA survey, it is clear that the \rbcg{} galaxy has much more extended 
    outer envelope, even though its median \mden{} profile is very similar 
    to the \nbcg{} sample at $< 10$ kpc. 
    We can reproduce very the same trend with the luminosity density profiles 
    (with or without $k$-correction), suggesting that the inaccurate \ser{} 
    model definitely leads to under-estimate of \mstar{}.
