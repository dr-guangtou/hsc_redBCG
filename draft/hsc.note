The hscPipe system is the standard pipeline developed for reduction and analysis of the
HSC Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) 1. We ran version 3.10.2 to reduce the F2 data. hscPipe
de-biases the images by evaluating a bias level from the overscan region. Trimming,
flat-fielding, cosmic ray rejection, and an astrometric solution based on a 5th order of
polynomial fit to the SDSS DR9 cat- alog follow the initial de-biasing. After reducing all
of the individual chips, hscPipe improves the mosaicking solution by fitting a 9th order
polynomial to the combination of all of the chips in a grid of overlapping 1.7Ã—1.7 deg2 square degree subregions of the F2 imaging data. In the HSC reduction system these subregions are called tracts.

With the resulting accurate CCD positions and flux scaling, hscPipe warps the individual images and stacks them by taking the arithmetic mean and rejecting de- viant pixels.
